Hi! Itâ€™s me again. This is a short one to share a project that Iâ€™ve been working on for a while. About a year ago, Bev and I got the chance to travel to Hong Kong and Japan. It was an amazing experience: the opportunity to return to the city of our birth, and then to explore a completely different culture.

I like to take a lot of pictures when I travel, and I often feel that the trip isnâ€™t complete until I edit and share the photos in some way. This time, I decided to build an interactive webpage with an animated map. Seeing how the trip happened a year ago, this is somewhat overdueâ€”chalk up the delay to my declining software skills ðŸ˜œ
