I‚Äôve written before about tools I‚Äôve used for building this website. To recap, I started with [Jekyll](placeholder), and I transitioned to [Gatsby](placeholder) because of... [reasons](placeholder).

I don‚Äôt have strong opinions about Gatsby. Being a React-based framework, it felt familiar because I had been working on several other React projects. Maybe a little _too_ familiar, as it turns out.

I started to hear about [Svelte](placeholder) and [SvelteKit](placeholder) early last year. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to port this site to SvelteKit. Recall that my primary motivation for switching to Gatsby was to allow me to use Tailwind as my styling solution, and I stuck with Tailwind for my SvelteKit rewrite.

Svelte is absolutely lovely. I love its syntax for expressing reactive UI state changes, and its use of _[stores](placeholder)_ for cross-component shared state. SvelteKit, though, I still have some reservations about. I won‚Äôt get into specifics here, because I acknowledge that it‚Äôs a relative newcomer (still in beta when I first picked it up), and I have faith that as it matures, it will continue to address some of the quirks that I encountered. If I were to start a  web application project, I would choose SvelteKit.

However, for a non-interactive blog website like this one, I don‚Äôt think that SvelteKit is the best fit. Its default mode is full-stack server-side rendering, not static site generation. In particular, it doesn‚Äôt have built-in support for content management (which Jekyll and Gatsby did), and I found myself writing a lot of custom code just to read Markdown text files from the filesystem and render them as HTML.

I‚Äôve learned that my Kryptonite is getting bogged down in coding details, and after stepping back from all of the SvelteKit and Tailwind tinkering, I had a painful realization: this website was kind of _ugly_. Design is a skill that I need to learn, just as much as coding.

This is the part of the story where I wag my finger at myself and say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you rewrote it _again_.‚Äù I‚Äôve had enough corporate software experience to instinctively recoil at the idea. Refactoring or rewriting a project even _once_ is essentially _verboten_, let alone three times.

That‚Äôs right, _three_. I‚Äôm now building this site using [Astro](placeholder).

In order to describe what I‚Äôm appreciating about Astro, I need to talk about a couple of mental shifts that I‚Äôve had in recent months.

## Regarding Tailwind


I called Tailwind ‚Äú[CSS without CSS](placeholder)‚Äù and to many, that‚Äôs a good thing. I fell in love with it, too, but the longer I spent with it, the more uncomfortable I got.

The initial appeal came from the feeling of ‚Äúmoving fast‚Äù: there‚Äôs an almost Zen-like trance that comes from typing short nubbins in the class list of an HTML element. But as soon as I needed to change something, it became tedious to scan that same list, as it got longer and longer. I think most Tailwind detractors criticize it on this front.

More importantly,  I started to think that maybe it wasn‚Äôt such a good idea to try to do CSS without CSS. There‚Äôs value in accepting CSS for what it is, instead of trying to hide it behind shortcuts for the sake of ‚Äúdeveloper experience.‚Äù 

**_Tailwind is to CSS as Coles Notes[^1] are to Shakespeare._** Why not just study Shakespeare?

## Anti-JS sentiment

I read a couple of [blog](https://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/) [posts](https://www.spicyweb.dev/the-great-gaslighting-of-the-js-age/) that angrily criticize the current state of web development. While their tone is too ‚Äúconspiracy theory rant‚Äù for my tastes, there‚Äôs a valid point there. Namely, Javascript frameworks (especially React) may have become dominant because of marketing and hype, not technical merit. And the consequence of putting Javascript first? A lot of extra load on browsers, and a lot of extra complexity in the development workflow.

I learned React by starting two projects at around the same time: one for an internal web tool at the software company where I was employed, and one for a small-business client with whom I was moonlighting as a freelancer. It didn‚Äôt feel like I had a choice: I felt pressure from my teammates at the software company to use React, probably because they hoped that their peripheral exposure to it would result in a line item on their r√©sum√©. Even my small-business client, who has little technical knowledge, suggested React. It‚Äôs a brand, and it has brand recognition in the marketplace of web development.

React appears to be easy to learn. The basic idea of rendering a DOM as a function of state is cool. However, in my experience, the basic idea is not enough to create applications that perform well and are easy to maintain. There are layers and layers of extensions and techniques[^2] that I had to learn along the way, usually because I was reacting[^3] to a situation where something was broken or slow.

**_The best practices are not built in_**, and I feel like every project team needs to take a different journey towards making their application the best that it can be.

## Back to basics

The web started with HTML and CSS, and I have been feeling a desire to go back to basics, and really grasp the fundamentals again.

For the longest time, I‚Äôve held onto the presumption that CSS doesn‚Äôt have the concept of variables. That‚Äôs why, in order to make your code reusable, you needed to use a [preprocessor](SASS), or [CSS-in-JS](styled%20components). But in fact, browsers have supported CSS [_custom properties_](placeholder) for several years now. Heavy reliance on Javascript frameworks has obfuscated my knowledge of these changes, and my understanding of web development became filtered through React-specific concepts.

[Astro](placeholder), then, is a breath of fresh air. Being focussed on static HTML generation first, it is most similar to [Jekyll](placeholder) and [Hugo](placeholder), which I touched briefly to build a [small site](https://jacob-rob.com). Astro is friendlier than either of these for developers who are already used to Javascript and JSX, since it doesn‚Äôt require picking up another language (Ruby and Go, respectively).

So far, Astro provides the best of all worlds:
- content management and Markdown support, like Jekyll and Gatsby
- single file components with scoped CSS, like Svelte
- if you need some interactive UI, you can plug in a framework component as an ‚Äú[island](placeholder)‚Äù - this can be React, Svelte, Vue, whatever. E.g. this site is largely Javascript-free, but I imported the interactive [search](/blog/search) functionality from the previous Svelte incarnation.

It‚Äôs ironic that I started with an HTML-first static site generator and came back all the way around. The anti-JS sentiment that I‚Äôve been seeing online might be a sign that the web community at large is taking a similar cyclical journey. Everything old is new again, it seems.
