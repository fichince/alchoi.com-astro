I was building the [404 page][1] for this site and a random idea occurred to me. I know that from a 404 message, you should always link back a valid page, usually the home page, but then I thought it’d be fun to link to a random blog post also.

I came up with a component that scrolls through a random selection of items with an animation like a slot machine. Svelte has some pretty cool features for supporting [transitions and animations][2], so I wanted to learn more about that.

You can play with the final result [here][3].

As a TODO for myself, maybe I’ll extract this as a reusable component and publish it.
