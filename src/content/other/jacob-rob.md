This is a book that I ghostwrote with a survivor of sexual trauma. The story follows his recovery and the impact that the event had on the rest of his life. I spent a lot of time interviewing and collaborating with my subject, and I greatly value the experience and his friendship. The book deals with difficult subject matter, but in the end, I believe it carries a message of hope.

> The only difference between Jacob and me is that he is Jacob and I am me.
> 
> The difference between us causes our stories to branch away from each other at the moment that the woman utters those words.

> "Iâ€™m going to kill myself."
