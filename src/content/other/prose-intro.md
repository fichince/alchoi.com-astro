title: My Writing
---

I've had a life-long interest in books and reading, and when I reached adulthood, I decided to try my hand at writing. It doesn't come easily to me; most of the time, I would rather be writing code than prose. But there's a satisfaction in creating a story or an essay that I don't get with software development.

Here, you'll find some links to pieces of writing that I've published. Enjoy!
