title: My Writing
---
This is the part of the site where I try to sound humble and self-deprecating, but there's really no way around it: it's straight-up bragging.

I've had a life-long interest in books and reading, and when I reached adulthood, I decided to try my hand at writing. It doesn't come easy to me; most of the time, I would rather be writing code instead of prose. But there's a satisfaction in creating a piece of fiction or an essay that I don't get with software development.

You'll find below links to pieces of writing that I've published. Enjoy!
