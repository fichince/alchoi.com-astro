I’m split on the opening _in medias res_ shot: we see the three main characters in a crucial moment, and we hear voices speculating on the question, “Who are they to each other?” I like the concept of the scene because I’ve played this game when people-watching in public spaces. On the other hand, the movie telegraphs itself, and I spent the first part of the movie impatient to get to the part which I knew was coming. But once it gets there… _wow_. It’s a masterclass of emotional tension, reminiscent of [_Moonlight_][1]’s diner scene.
