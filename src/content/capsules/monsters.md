The premise of this book tickled a morbid sense of fascination in me: it asks, _what do we do with the art of monstrous men?_ (Think Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby.)

More on that later. I actually engaged most with the book when it took a slight digression to discuss a type of "monster" that we don't talk about often: a mother who abandons her children to pursue art. The author wonders if parenthood is incompatible with creativity, and dares to ask if she would have been a better writer if she hadn't become a mother. Even though there's a distinct feminist slant to the book, I found myself identifying with this section as I follow my journey towards potentially becoming a father.

Back to the original question: what do we do with the art of monstrous men? I wasn't sure that I really needed an answer, frankly. I'm of the opinion that there are no hard and fast rules for this kind of thing. Always strive to know the truth, and if it makes you uncomfortable, then you can choose to stop engaging with an artist's work. But on the other hand, you should still enjoy what you enjoy, as long as you acknowledge the truth, however ugly it may be.

As summed up in _Monsters_:

> The way you consume art doesn’t make you a bad person, or a good one. You’ll have to find some other way to accomplish that.
