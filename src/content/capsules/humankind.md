_Humankind_ by Rutger Bregman is a book that attempts to overturn the prevailing view that people are inherently selfish and malevolent. From the oft-referenced stories of the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) and [Kitty Genovese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese), to the everyday news, we hear a lot about the sins of humankind. Bregman dismantles these stories, arguing that they only preserve existing power and economic structures. Instead, he aims to show that weâ€™re motivated by kindness towards others.

The book is a breezy read, filled with snappy anecdotes and factoids. It worked on me: at the beginning, I read with skepticism, trying to poke holes in his arguments; but by the end, I found everything he was saying to be obvious. Run a school without classes and lesson plans, because the students will naturally find their own path to learning? Of course! Run a prison without cells, and where the guards play games and sing songs with the inmates? Sounds like a great idea! 

It was as if the book had created a new intuition in me: take everything that is considered conventional in modern society, and _do the opposite._
