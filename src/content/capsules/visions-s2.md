This series is a collection of short animated films set in the _Star Wars_ universe, without any concern for continuity. I wasn’t too hot on the first season, in which every episode was made by a different Japanese anime studio. Consequently, I found it monotonous, because many of the films had the same samurai feel. No offense to samurai.

Season 2, on the other hand, is much more diverse. I’m glad they expanded the palette to include animation studios from around the world. A highlight was “Screecher’s Reach”, with its painterly animation style, and horror-like journey into a dark cave.
