I got into the original _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ series sometime in the mid-2000’s. Always been a fan of the creative creature designs and gory action, but never really _got_ what was happening from a story perspective. When the _Rebuild_ series started in the early 2010’s, promising a more accessible and clearer story, I watched the first film and decided to wait for the rest before bingeing them together. A decade later, the series is complete and I finally revisited this world.

It kind of felt like one step forward, two steps back for me: while this version does explain some plot elements earlier, it also adds so many new ideas that the net result is just as confusing as the original series. I’m also not a huge fan of the CG “2.5-D” animation style, especially in the latter two movies, which just looked like a fluid simulation exercise at times.

Overall, I think it’s skippable… better to just rewatch the original series.
