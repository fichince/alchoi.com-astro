An improvement over the first entry, mostly because the cast of characters is more diverse. The core characters that span both books (the crew of the _Rocinante_) are growing on me, which is what you want in a spacefaring series. If you’re looking for more heady ideas, or a more thematically rich story, this isn’t it. This is more like an action thriller than an intellectual exploration.
