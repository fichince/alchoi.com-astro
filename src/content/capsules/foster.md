A short novella that you _can_ read in one sitting, but may be worth savouring over a few quiet evenings. The story tells of a young girl whose overwhelmed parents drop her off with another couple for the summer. The setup is inherently sad, and the feeling of being unwanted is always hanging there, even though it's not spoken.

There's also a sense of timelessness about the setting; there's no specific mention of when the story occurs. There's no obvious references to cellphones or present-day technology, but you could believe that it's happening now.

I admit I found it a bit slow at times, but the devastating final lines really grabbed me and made me want to read it again someday.
