I’ve lately gone on a kick of [revisiting](/quick-reviews/inglourious-basterds) [movies](/quick-reviews/arrival) that have left a lasting impression on me. With that in mind, I rewatched this pair of Ari Aster films in quick succession, and my snap verdict is: _Midsommar_ has gone up in my estimation, while _Hereditary_ has gone down.

I don’t scare easily at horror movies, but part of the reason is because I tend to avoid seeing them in the theatre. The big screen and loud sound, along with being surrounded by the dark, would probably overwhelm me, and raise the fear factor beyond what I’d be comfortable with.[^1] This is all to give _Hereditary_ the credit that it deserves: it freaked me the hell out the first time I watched it, even in the comfort of my basement man cave. On this second viewing, because I knew what was coming, it didn’t hit me much. I didn’t expect to be scared, but great horror can be rewatched because it offers more than fear[^2], and _Hereditary_ didn’t.

_Midsommar_, on the other hand, opened up for me the second time around. I don’t think it was ever really that scary in the first place, more shocking and disturbing. Without the element of surprise, it becomes a fascinating exploration of how outsiders perceive “foreign” cultures, and the thin line between community and cult.

Things that connect the two films:
- The lead actors, Toni Collette and Florence Pugh, are both great.
- Corpses in Aster’s movies have a bloodless, rubbery quality that I “enjoy.” I can’t say they’re realistic, but they’re also not clearly fake. It’s like a gross, macabre version of the Yoda puppet in _The Empire Strikes Back_.

I propose that a recent, comparable film, [_No One Will Save You_](https://letterboxd.com/film/no-one-will-save-you/), didn’t feel very scary to me (though still enjoyable) because I watched it at home.
