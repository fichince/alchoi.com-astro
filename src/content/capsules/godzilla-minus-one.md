On the one hand, there's a surprising amount of emotional and political depth here, to make the monster action scenes more impactful. The film doesn't shy away from criticizing the idea of honourable sacrifice, which as I understand it, is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, and gives us things like [_sepukku_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku) and [_kamikaze_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamikaze).

On the other hand, my enjoyment was tampered a bit by the acting style, which leans towards the melodramatic. There's also a toddler who, when she cries, seems to have been dubbed over with the sound of an infant crying.
