I don't want to criticize this book too harshly. It's well-written and readable, and my wife really loved it and got a lot out of it. 

The author's main argument can be summed up as: "Work sucks sometimes, but you are not your job, so don't take it personally." Each chapter is a mini-profile of someone who has experienced the suckage of work, and how they have learned the lesson that they shouldn't have felt so bad about it, and that they should focus on what _really_ matters.

But the things that suck about work still suck, whether you take it personally or not. It's easy in hindsight to make the case that you should detach from the job, but it's not so easy when it's happening to you. I found myself wishing for justice from the employers who caused the suckage, but I suppose that would be another type of book.
