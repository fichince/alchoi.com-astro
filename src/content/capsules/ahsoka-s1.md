The pacing can be a bit slow in this show, but whenever the action kicks in, it’s a thrill. Sabine’s combat style--a mix of novice lightsaber handling, and expert use of Mandalorian weaponry--is fun to watch. As a character, she brings a lightness and attitude that's missing from most of _Star Wars_ these days. Indeed, Ahsoka herself is so dispassionate that she feels like a side character in her own show. Overall, I enjoyed as a _Rebels_ revisit, which makes me wonder how it lands with an audience who isn't familiar with that earlier show.
