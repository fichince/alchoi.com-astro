This is a joint review of the two parts of Denis Villeneuve’s _Dune_. It’s obvious that aesthetically, the film is amazing. Visuals, character design, sound design, music: all great. I’ve had [Hans Zimmer’s score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Dune_%282021_film%29) running through my head for the past two years. The [scene with the throat-singing shaman or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEymyO5Abp4) is burned into my brain.

On the other hand, I found the storytelling difficult to get a grasp on. In each of the two parts, I enjoyed the scene-setting of the first half of the runtime. But then, as soon as the plot started to accelerate towards the end, the pacing felt both slow and rushed at the same time. I think the story is just too complicated to fit into a movie. (Maybe, just _maybe_, the early 2000’s [miniseries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B1nfv65xQY) and [its sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rBXcsk-BeE) did a better job of making the story clear, but I haven’t watched those in a long time, and I don’t trust my fond memories of it.)

At the end of the day, the feeling I’m left with the most is the desire to read the books again.
