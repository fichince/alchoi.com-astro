The premise and visual design of this show intrigued me enough for me to give it a watch. It takes place in a multi-level underground bunker, where the members of the population are not allowed to go out. The look of the show reminds me of the _Fallout_ video games.

This show started off strong. The third episode is a standout, creating white-knuckle suspense from an engineering/mechanical problem. Unfortunately, beyond that episode, after the main character becomes the sheriff of the silo, it becomes a bit of a slog. She becomes fixated on the mystery of her loverâ€™s death, which is only peripherally related to the mysteries that we as viewers want to solve: namely, what the heck is up with this silo, anyway?
