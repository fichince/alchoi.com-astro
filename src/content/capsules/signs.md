I have a clear memory of watching this movie in theatres in 2002. At the time, I was living in my parents’ house and we had houseguests, which meant that I had to surrender my room and sleep in the then-unfinished basement. That night after watching _Signs_, I wished I had my own room, and I was glad when our dog joined me in the dark.

Even though I haven’t rewatched it in at least 15 years, the film still felt familiar. It’s not as scary as that first time, because I think the construction and rhythm of the set pieces have left an impression on me like a memorable song. The script may be a bit overcooked, but the humour and familial sweetness work for me because of the performances.
