I’ve been selectively revisiting the _X-Men_ series, which, as a whole, are known to be a mixed bag. At their best[^1], they’re great action spectacles that effectively explore the opposing philosophies of Professor X and Magneto. At their worst… well, I didn’t rewatch the bad ones, so I won’t comment.

These two entries, both directed by James Mangold, stand apart from the rest in the way that they zoom into the psychology of a single character. _The Wolverine_ is the more conventionally comic-booky of the two, featuring ninjas and a cool bullet train fight scene. _Logan_ doesn’t feel like a superhero movie at all, and lands more like a crime drama, with brutal violence that makes you feel every kill.

Both follow a similar emotional arc for the character: he’s a broken man, haunted by the past, until he finds someone to care for and protect. It’s especially effective in _Logan_, due to the compelling performance by Dafne Keen as Wolverine’s clone-daughter. 

I have to say though, Wolverine’s lack of emotional range (99.5% brooding and angry, 0.5% vulnerable) is more noticeably one-note when he’s flying solo and not part of a team.
