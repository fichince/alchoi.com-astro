I chose to watch this show because of its star, Alicia Vikander. Probably my biggest celebrity crush. She’s alluring as always in _Irma Vep_ as an actress cast in a niche indie miniseries remake of a [silent-era French film][1]. There’s lots of behind-the-scenes filmmaking stuff which is both satirical about the excesses of turbulent artists, and sentimental about the purity of said artistry. It’s also cool to geek out with the layers of self-reference: we see scenes from the film-within-a-film, along with real footage from the original silent film, along with re-enactments of the production of the original silent film. Oh, I forgot to mention: _Irma Vep_ itself is a remake of a film, and we see scenes from that film spliced in here as well. Throw in some unexpected supernatural turns and the scenery of Paris, and it adds up to a fun, chill, occasionally mind-bending watch.
