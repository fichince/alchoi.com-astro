I hold [_The Social Network_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-social-network/) in high esteem as one of my favourite movies, and so it's high praise when I say that _BlackBerry_ belongs in the same conversation.

I remember when "The Facebook Movie" came out, it was criticized for its factual inaccuracy, especially because it depicts such recent events. _BlackBerry_, I suppose, will be immune to this criticism because there's no mistake that the characters are exaggerated caricactures. The movie is way funnier than I expected it to be.

Also enjoyable are the local references, e.g. Ontario license plates, Shoppers Drug Mart, Tim Horton's. There's even a quick shot of someone paying with a 20 CAD bill with the old design that I haven't seen in real life for years.
