I was sucked in for most of this novel, which tells the story of a middle-aged man who meets two mysterious women in the wake of his wife's death. Each of the three characters have painful secrets in their past, and I was fascinated by how they each tried to hide themselves from the others, while still trying to grow closer.

Unfortunately, I didn't think that the final revelations were very satisfying. The plot introduces one too many extramarital affairs, in my opinion. Even though it is meant to mirror another affair, it just felt like it came out of nowhere. Also, I found the prose style (or the translation) to be a bit repetitive ("It was the most unusual winter...")

But overall, I enjoyed my time with this book.
