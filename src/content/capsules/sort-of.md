We just finished watching the three seasons of this Toronto-based show about a gender-fluid person. The show started off more as a comedy in its first season, and I felt that it shifted more towards drama as it progressed. I respect the show for not giving into the temptation to follow the typical rom-com happy-ending route. The main character Sabi is defined by their feelings of not knowing where they belong, and I think it's fair to say that they're not ready at this stage in their life to be in a long-term relationship.

The plotting maybe relied a bit too much on big shocking events, and didn't give the characters enough time to process them before moving onto the next twist. You could say that it's true to life, but I would have liked to see more falling action to balance out the escalations. Still, the show is a valuable lesson in empathy for people who are different.
