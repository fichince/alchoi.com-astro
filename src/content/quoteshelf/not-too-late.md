quotes:
- I say all this to you because hope is not like a lottery ticket you can sit on the
  sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. I say this because hope is an ax you break down
  doors with in an emergency.
- Well, what if your power in this fight lies not in what you can do as an individual
  but in your ability to be part of a collective? What if you broadened your perspective
  beyond what you can accomplish alone and let yourself see what you could do if you
  lent your efforts to something bigger? Yes, it’s true that you can’t solve the climate
  crisis alone, but it’s even more true that we can’t solve it without you. It’s a
  team sport.
