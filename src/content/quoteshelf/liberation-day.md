author: George Saunders
quotes:
- I am going, friend, I am all but gone, I believe you prideful and wrong but I have
  no desire, now, to cure you. Your wrongness was an idea I had. I am all but gone.
  My idea of your wrongness will go with me. Your rightness is an idea you are having.
  It will go with you.
- |-
  Why? Why must this be? Is there not abundance enough and beauty to support all in peace, were that the general intention?

  There is.

  But peace is not the general intention.
- '"I guess one never realizes how little one wants to be kicked to death until one
  hears a crowd doing that exact same thing to someone nearby," I say.'
- 'If you''ll allow me a crude metaphor (as I''m sure you, the King of Las Bromas
  de Fartos, will): a guy comes into a dinner party, takes a dump on the rug in the
  living room. The guests get excited, yell out in protest. He takes a second dump.
  The guests feel, Well, yelling didn''t help. (While some of them applaud his audacity.)
  He takes a third dump, on the table, and still no one throws him out. At that point,
  the sky has become the limit in terms of future dumps.'
- For, whatever Mr. U. may in the future give me to Speak, I will never enjoy it again,
  any more than would a puppet, picked up off the floor, enjoy the suddenly manipulating
  hand.
