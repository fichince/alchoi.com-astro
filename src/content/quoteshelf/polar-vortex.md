quotes:
- “They're not blind or deaf. They'll eventually feel the envy from people right here
  in the town who see themselves as also in dire need but who were never given a free
  house or car. They'll see that Canadians aren't necessarily all as warm and cuddly
  as we're currently making ourselves out to be. And still, they'll forever have to
  be expressing how grateful they are to us."
- That's what it is to live in a family. Constant negotiation. Perhaps it's true that
  all good things are bound to come to an end. Entropy. The law of physics. All things
  fall apart. But things also go in cycles, of course. Gravity. Decline. Disintegration.
  And then renewal. The process toward disintegration beginning always in renewal,
  and renewal preceding *and* following disintegration.
- We've been living together almost half a dozen years, but there are times I look
  at Alex's face in repose and realize I have no idea what goes on in her head unless
  she actually tells me. And if I were to ask her what is on her mind, how do I know
  if what she'd tell me is the truth? I can't know. And vice versa. We just have to
  trust. Or believe. There's a difference between these two, isn't there? I wonder
  what she really sees of me that she doesn't say out loud.
- '"I guess that''s the thing about getting older, isn''t it?" Alex said. We''d been
  chatting, just days ago, pleasantly at last, as if all was well between us, and
  then she came at it from what she might have thought of as slightly higher ground:
  "We start searching for anyone and everyone we used to know in our younger days.
  That''s what social media has done to us. It makes us imagine we can create this
  expansive story, this full picture, of our lives, stitch every single recorded moment
  of our pasts and presents together seamlessly. Everyone''s an artist these days,
  creating self-portraits, portraits via social media of their world."'
- During the decades when our friendship ebbed and flowed in the natural, uncontrived
  way that it did, I'd not really bothered myself too much about the whys and whereofs
  of it. But in the last few years, after the intentionality of the distancing, whenever
  he'd come to mind, something welled up, making me a little ill, remorseful. I noticed
  at some point that I have a tendency to hum a single note whenever I think of him.
  It is not exactly a pleasant sound but more like a sound meant to hide a groan.
  This strange, sudden, and involuntary emission is a chord made up of the notes of
  regret, remorse, and guilt. So perhaps my need to get on with a visit with him is
  not really out of the blue. What is out of the blue is the recognition of this pending
  visit as a chance to clean up an aspect of my life—a chance to scrub karma, or something
  like that.
- It's possible, at least in the very grand scheme of things, that thoughts are more
  material than they are ephemeral, like radio or energy waves, and must necessarily
  leave our brains, and when they do they float out into the universe. If so, then
  a googolplexian of thoughts—oh, way more than that, a googolplexian times a googolplexian
  of one-word thoughts, novel-length thoughts, unfinished thoughts, all, this minute,
  are criss-crossing the universe, each carried in a microscopic elastic bubble of
  something like an invisible gas or whatever medium might surround and preserve it.
  The bubbles are so small, smaller than a proton, that no invented microscope could
  see them as they slam into each other, and although they do so, no bubble is ever
  punctured because the gas or oil that preserves them is also slippery. They float
  bump slip slide float and bump again until they arrive at the head of the person
  or persons to whom they pertain. Perhaps they buzz—without an actual buzz sound,
  of course, perhaps more like a vibration—waiting for their intended receptor to
  tune in, to undo the latch, open the mind, and catch them.
- The feeling of jealousy, as long as its causes are not wounding, affect a delightful
  flame in me. This provocation and playfulness of feigned jealousies was a shared
  trait, a sensibility, that attracted us to each other.
- Time came and went, and if anything changed it was my heart. It toughened. An enormous
  amount of energy is required for a heart to toughen, and in the end it's draining.
