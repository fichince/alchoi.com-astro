title: I Didn't Do the Thing Today
author: Madeleine Dore
quotes:
- 'Perhaps we don’t want to be more productive in our days, but more fecund—that is,
  more capable of producing new growth, but not always in producing mode. Seen in
  this light, our days are like fertile gardens: a place to plant, to sow, to weed,
  to prune, to pick, to compost, depending on the season'
