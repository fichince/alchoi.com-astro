title: The Year of Magical Thinking (Vintage International)
author: Joan Didion
quotes:
- This is my attempt to make sense of the period that followed, weeks and then months
  that cut loose any fixed idea I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability
  and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about
  grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life
  ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.
