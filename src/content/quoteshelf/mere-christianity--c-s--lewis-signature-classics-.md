author: C. S. Lewis
quotes:
- Men have differed as regards what people you ought to be unselfish to—whether it
  was only your own family, or your fellow countrymen, or every one. But they have
  always agreed that you ought not to put yourself first. Selfishness has never been
  admired.
- These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all
  over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way,
  and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that
  way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation
  of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.
- In the case of stones and trees and things of that sort, what we call the Laws of
  Nature may not be anything except a way of speaking. When you say that nature is
  governed by certain laws, this may only mean that nature does, in fact, behave in
  a certain way. The so-called laws may not be anything real—anything above and beyond
  the actual facts which we observe. But in the case of Man, we saw that this will
  not do. The Law of Human Nature, or of Right and Wrong, must be something above
  and beyond the actual facts of human behaviour. In this case, besides the actual
  facts, you have something else—a real law which we did not invent and which we know
  we ought to obey.
- Supposing science ever became complete so that it knew every single thing in the
  whole universe. Is it not plain that the questions, 'Why is there a universe?' ‘Why
  does it go on as it does?' ‘Has it any meaning?' would remain just as they were?
- 'If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has
  no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures
  with eyes, we should never know it was dark. *Dark* would be a word without meaning.'
- My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how
  had I got this idea of *just* and *unjust*? A man does not call a line crooked unless
  he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when
  I called it unjust?
