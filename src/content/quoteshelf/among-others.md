title: Among Others
author: Jo Walton
quotes:
- You can almost always find chains of coincidence to disprove magic. That's because
  it doesn't happen the way it does in books. It makes those chains of coincidence.
  That's what it is. It's like if you snapped your fingers and produced a rose but
  it was because someone on an aeroplane had dropped a rose at just the right time
  for it to land in your hand. There was a real person and a real aeroplane and a
  real rose, but that doesn't mean the reason you have the rose in your hand isn't
  because you did the magic.
- Memories are like a big pile of carpets, I keep them piled up in one big pile in
  my head and don't pay much attention to them separately, but if I want to, I can
  get back in and walk on them and remember. I'm not really there, not like an elf
  might be, of course. It's just that if I remember being sad or angry or chagrined,
  a little of that feeling comes back. And the same goes for happy, of course, though
  I can easily wear out the happy memories by thinking about them too much. If I do,
  when I'm old all the bad memories will still be sharp, because of pushing them away,
  but all the good ones will be worn out.
