title: No One Is Talking About This
author: Patricia Lockwood
quotes:
- 'Why did rich people believe they worked harder? Her theory was that it was because
  they identified with the pile of money itself. And gathering interest, multiplying
  hotly, climbing its own slopes like a fever, heightening its silver, its gold, its
  green—what was that but work? When you thought about it that way, they never slept,
  but stayed wide-eyed as numerals 365 days a year, every last digit of them busy,
  awake in the clinking, the shuffle, the rustle, while eagles with pure platinum
  feathers swooped above them to create a wind. When you thought about it that way,
  of course they deserved it all, and looked with rightful contempt at the coppery
  disgraces all around them: those two cents that refused to even rub themselves together.'
- 'Capitalism! It was important to hate it, even though it was how you got money.
  Slowly, slowly, she found herself moving toward a position so philosophical even
  Jesus couldn''t have held it: that she must hate capitalism while at the same time
  loving film montages set in department stores.'
- There was a new toy. Everyone was making fun of it, but then it was said to be designed
  for autistic people, and then no one made fun of it anymore, but made fun of the
  people who were making fun of it previously. Then someone else discovered a stone
  version from a million years ago in some museum, and this seemed to prove something.
  Then the origin of the toy was revealed to have something to do with Israel and
  Palestine, and so everyone made a pact never to speak of it again. And all of this
  happened in the space of like four days.
- Politics! The trouble was that they had a dictator now, which, according to some
  people (white), they had never had before, and according to other people (everyone
  else), they had only ever been having, constantly, since the beginning of the world.
- Her teacup rose to her lips, tilted, floated away again. Raising her head from her
  spellbound reading a moment later, the cup was nowhere to be seen—not on the side
  table, not spilled on the floor or rolled between the unmade bedsheets. Its watercolor
  garden, shy thatched cottage, and rim of gilt were gone. She spent half an hour
  looking, increasingly spooked, for what hummed in her right hand was the feeling
  that she had put it somewhere inside the phone.
- The people who lived in the portal were often compared to those legendary experiment
  rats who kept hitting a button over and over to get a pellet. But at least the rats
  were getting a pellet, or the hope of a pellet, or the memory of a pellet. When
  we hit the button, all we were getting was to be more of a rat.
- 'That night, in the hotel room, she and her husband climbed in on opposite sides
  of the bed and suddenly their marriage leaped through a mirror: his face was too
  large, their lips felt like other people''s lips, when he tried to lift his right
  arm to touch her he lifted his left instead. "No," he shrieked after a minute, "go
  back, go back! Right side, right side, right side!"'
- In contrast with her generation, which had spent most of its time online learning
  to code so that it could add crude butterfly animations to the backgrounds of its
  weblogs, the generation immediately following had spent most of its time online
  making incredibly bigoted jokes in order to laugh at the idiots who were stupid
  enough to think they meant it. Except after a while they did mean it, and then somehow
  at the end of it they were Nazis. Was this always how it happened?
- It's true that they were no longer as close as they once were. "If I get shot in
  a Walmart, put my ashes in a sugar bowl and let Dad stir a big spoonful of me into
  his coffee every morning for the rest of his life and *I hope he likes the taste*,"
  she had squealed to her mother during their last phone call, in a voice nearly two
  octaves higher than usual. Not that she hadn't always thought that, or some variation
  on it. But at some point it had been possible not to say these things out loud.
- 'Even a spate of sternly worded articles called "Guess What: Tech Has an Ethics
  Problem" was not making tech have less of an ethics problem. Oh man. If *that* wasn''t
  doing it, what would??'
- Increasingly we were worried about the new sense of humor. Unlike the old sense
  of humor, which had mostly been about the difference between the way black people
  and white people drove cars, wasn't the new sense of humor just a little bit *random*?
  The funniest thing now, it seemed, was a fake ad for a product that couldn't exist,
  and how were we supposed to laugh at that, when the thought of a product that couldn't
  exist made us so unhappy?
- The question that was the pure liquid element of the portal—who am I failing to
  protect?—had found its stopped-clock answer. She fell heavily out of the broad warm
  us, out of the story that had seemed, up till the very last minute, to require her
  perpetual co-writing. Oh, she thought hazily, falling rainwise like Alice, finding
  tucked under her arm the bag of peas she once photoshopped into pictures of historical
  atrocities, oh, have I been *wasting my time*?
- During those weeks animals came up to her on the street and pushed their soft muzzles
  into her palm, and she always said the same two words, never wondering whether they
  were a lie or not, the words that dumb things depend on us to say—because when a
  dog runs to you and nudges against your hand for love and you say automatically,
  *I know, I know*, what else are you talking about except the world?
- |-
  It was a marvel how cleanly and completely this lifted her out of the stream of regular life. She was a gleaming sterilized instrument, flashing out at the precise moment of emergency. She chugged hot hospital coffee and then went, "AHHHHH," like George Clooney on *ER*, like she was off to go slice out the tumor that had lately been pressing on the world's optic nerve. She wanted to stop people on the street and say, "Do you know about this? You should know about this. No one is talking about this!"

  OK, or she was a gleaming instrument until the moment she shut her bedroom door at night, at which point she exploded into a white mist of tears and strange gasping sounds that were a million years before or after language. For she had spent the last two years letting things sink in, and now…  guess what, bitch! Further absorption was no longer possible! All day she drank in information, but no one was telling them the main thing. No one was telling them how long they would have her, how long the open cloud of her would last.
- Different, yes, different. But we were going to be different, the future had asked
  it of us, we had already begun to change. And there was almost no human being so
  unlike other human beings that it did not know what a kiss was.
