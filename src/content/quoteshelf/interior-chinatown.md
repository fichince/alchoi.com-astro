quotes:
- |-
  Ever since you were a boy, you've dreamt of being Kung Fu Guy.

  You are not Kung Fu Guy.

  You are currently Background Oriental Male, but you've been practicing.

  Maybe tomorrow will be the day.
- Poor is relative, of course. None of you were rich or had any dreams of being rich
  or even knew anyone rich. But the widest gulf in the world is the distance between
  getting by and not quite getting by.
- The apologies, the true sign—that this was not the man you once knew, a man who
  would never have uttered that word to his son, sorry, and in English, no less. Not
  because he thought himself infallible, but because of his belief that a family should
  never have to say sorry, or please, or thank you, for that matter, these things
  being redundant, being contradictory to the parent-son relationship, needing to
  remain unstated always, these things being the invisible fabric of what a family
  is.

  Ever since you were a boy, you've dreamt of being Kung Fu Guy.

  You're not Kung Fu Guy.

  But maybe, just maybe, tomorrow will be the day.
- He says something you don't quite follow. You hear it, you catch most of the individual
  words, and yet somehow—you don't understand. This gap, always there. Somehow unbridgeable,
  whether it's across a wide Pacific gulf of language and culture, or just a simple
  sentence, father to son, always distance. The texture of everyday actions, simple
  movements and gestures, is harder than it looks. The great shame of your life that
  you can't speak his language, not really, not fluently.
