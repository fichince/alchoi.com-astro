[RISE Cities][1] is an organization that shares and supports innovative and scalable solutions for **_R_**esilient, **_I_**ntelligent, **_S_**ustainable and **_E_**quitable cities.

Their website is another [Nomadic Labs][2] project, and I joined to build a new page for the [Fellowship][3] program. The page contains a neat little SVG map, which was a fun challenge to build.
