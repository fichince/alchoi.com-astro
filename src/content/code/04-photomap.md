This one is purely a hobby project. I wanted to create a slideshow of my 2023 vacation pictures to share with my friends and family, in a format that wouldn’t bore them to tears. In the past, I’ve edited slideshows into videos with music, and this time, I decided to take it one step further, and make it interactive.

To put this together, I used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to handle the routing and navgiation, [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/) to drive the map animations and transitions, and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) to make the photos expandable and zoomable.
