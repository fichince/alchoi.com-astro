[Pathways to Care][1] is a community-driven and youth-led systems change project committed to transforming the mental healthcare system for Black children, youth and their families.

Originally created by [Nomadic Labs][2], I joined the project in 2022 to develop some new features, including:
- an intake form to allow mental health clinics to submit their information to the site, and be added to the map
- updating the webpage to include the latest content from their Instagram feed
- adding a live search functionality to the map of mental health services
