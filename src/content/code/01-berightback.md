My dog Tinkerbell suffers from separation anxiety, meaning that she can't be left alone in the house. I sought help online, and came across a trainer named [Julie Naismith][1] who specializes in this issue.

Her method involves gradually training the dog and tracking the sessions in what was then a rudimentary web application. As her user base grew, she wanted to improve the appâ€™s features, and I threw my hat into the ring to become the lead developer on the project.

The project started in 2020, and after rebuilding the app with a modern tech stack (Ruby on Rails, React), I continue to work on improving and adding new features.
