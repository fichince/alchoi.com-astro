What I did for my movie-watching history in the [previous post](/blog/2025-01-17-letterboxd-reviews), I’ve done for my book reviews in this one. This habit started on [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com), but I grew dissatisfied with the UI/UX design on that site, and so moved over to [The Storygraph](https://thestorygraph.com).

With this, I think I can say that everything that I’ve ever written on the Internet (apart from social media, which, who cares?) now lives on this website, which I have full control over.

One thing I would like to explore in the future is going in the other direction. I.e. when I write something and post it on this website, I should also share it on Letterboxd or Storygraph, or whatever platforms spring up in the future. There’s a name for this approach: [POSSE, which stands for "Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere."](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) It could be as simple as copy and pasting, but as a software developer, I can’t help but try to find a way to automate it.

Let’s see if I get around to it...

### [_Alias Grace_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1d49afcf-01ea-4ee4-9807-d9c0dee045e5) <small>by Margaret Atwood</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-04-20</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

It was well-written and I enjoyed the narration of Grace, the main character.  But I had a problem with the character of the doctor, Simon.  It seemed like the character of Simon was meant to be a parallel to Grace, but I don't think the book spends enough time with his story to fully develop that connection.  It would have been better if the time was evenly divided between the two characters, or just focussed on Grace herself.  The chapters about Simon seemed tacked on; and I found that his subplot ended abruptly.

My favourite parts were the sections that consisted of letters between the different characters, especially the letters from Simon's mother.  She played the motherly guilt trip in a way that was real and funny.

### [_The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0b1d298f-947f-4f95-8351-6d59c5d2a7f9) <small>by David A. Price</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-11-28</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

This book does a good job of balancing the three different aspects of Pixar's story.  One, the development of the technology that they use to produce computer graphics.  Two, the creative process that goes into finding and perfecting the stories and ideas in their movies.  Three, the business deals and relationships between the key players.  The book would be interesting if it was about any one of these areas; combining them together made for an entertaining and informative read.

### [_Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f5d8004b-f810-4eab-9389-78de2121a5a4) <small>by Mary Roach</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-12-03</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I might have been grossed out in some parts if it hadn't been so funny...

### [_Sacred Games_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/22f5244b-b876-41fc-9532-ffec23c7e8cd) <small>by Vikram Chandra</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-02-08</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

It took me a very long time to read _Sacred Games_, and it was mostly worth it.  There are some powerful moments and I liked the overall setting and style, but it was ultimately a bit uneven.

When I first started reading it, the language took a bit of getting used to.  Chandra uses a lot of words in various Indian languages.  Even the characters' names were hard to keep track of because they are unfamiliar.  There is a large glossary, but I found that it was too cumbersome to flip to it all the time, and it was better just to read on.  Usually the context was enough to provide understanding.

Structurally, the novel is quite interesting.  Chapters alternate between focussing on Sartaj Singh, a police detective, and Ganesh Gaitonde, a crime boss.  The two characters actually meet in the first chapter and Gaitonde dies.  The rest of the Gaitonde chapters are flashbacks of his criminal "career" and what lead to his end, while the Sartaj chapters deal with his investigation into the same events.  Apart from this alternating series of chapters, there are occasional chapters called "Insets" that have to do with peripheral characters who may or may not affect the main plot.

Because of this structure, the experience is like reading two separate novels, with the Insets acting like short stories thrown into the mix.  I thought the Gaitonde story was a bit stronger than Sartaj's.  Parts of it reminded me of the De Niro parts of _The Godfather Part II_, particularly near the beginning when he is working his up the criminal hierarchy.  When he becomes the boss, his mental state often fluctuates between aggressive cockiness and paranoid insecurity.  I can imagine that the stresses of being the head of a crime organization would do that to you.

One of my favourite chapters was the Inset revolving around Sartaj's mother's childhood.  The writing style reflected a different time and conveyed a childlike perspective.  I won't spoil it, but what happens is really traumatic, while also tying into the themes of the larger plot.

The main problem I had with the book was the scale of the plot.  After finishing it, I can now see that the story comes together.  But during the course of reading it, it felt like there were many excessive diversions.  Sometimes it would tie into the plot, and sometimes not.  While I admire the richness of it, I was often left thinking to myself, "Why is this important?"  As an example, the penultimate chapter involves a character who has seemingly not been previously introduced.  We basically go through his entire life story before we find out that he is in fact a background character who was involved an earlier event involving one of the main characters.  The fact that this chapter takes place after the climax of the main plot made it seem really out of place and unnecessary.

Overall, I liked the immersiveness of _Sacred Games_, but maybe it was so immersive that sometimes I lost track of the point.

### [_Operation Mincemeat: How a Dead Man and a Bizarre Plan Fooled the Nazis and Assured an Allied Victory_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/64a3aa63-fa61-49f6-91af-b4428d1e9d52) <small>by Ben Macintyre</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-02-25</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

The thing that struck me most while reading this was how much luck was involved in the operation's success.  It's fascinating how such an event as large-scale as the invasion of Sicily was affected by a series of small events that made Operation Mincemeat work.  Little things like finding the right photograph to match the dead body, the documents landing in the hands of an anti-Nazi German officer, etc... if any of those things had happened differently, the entire operation could have failed.  The book does a good job of revealing these turns of fortune in an entertaining way so that it reads like a suspense novel.

### [_Black Hole_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/655f3acd-f1d0-43fc-9f36-872efc724d45) <small>by Charles Burns</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

Other than the gross-out factor of the effects of "The Bug" disease, I didn't really find it very interesting.  The story is pretty typical teenage angst stuff.

### [_Blankets_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/847cffea-c929-4a60-ac59-6ee604c48cec) <small>by Craig Thompson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-07</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

Imaginative drawings.  Nice story.  Sad story.

### [_A Clockwork Orange_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f08c7201-78f3-4740-9373-569688dea3d4) <small>by Anthony Burgess</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-20</small>

<span><sl-rating value="5.0" readonly /></span>

Second time reading the book.  Have seen the movie many times.  I still find the language and voice entertaining.

I believe this was the first time I've been exposed to the last chapter (older editions have the last chapter cut out, and the movie doesn't adapt the last chapter).  I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It does provide a nice symmetry to the first chapter, but I thought it was a bit too convenient.  It features a character change in Alex that seems like it's just there to make a point and to end it on a positive note.

### [_Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/93a0cf6b-9cd3-4717-ac48-bcca4f25a84c) <small>by Jack Weatherford</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-25</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

In a way, the title is misleading.  I was expecting something like a biography of Genghis Khan, and it is that to start with.  I was surprised when the death of Genghis Khan occurred about a third of the way through the book.  There's a definite tonal change at this point.  The parts about Genghis's early life and eventual rise to power feel more like legends and myths because the research is drawn from stories that were probably passed down orally before being recorded historically.  After his death, the book shifts to a more high-level account of his descendants and empire.  As the empire grew, so did the number of "proper" historians taking down the events.  As a result, the text becomes more encyclopedic and less personal, and I found it less compelling.  Still, I learned a lot about a subject that I wasn't that familiar with before, so it's good.

### [_The Monkeyface Chronicles_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f80cd1bf-8cc1-4a33-9e8e-749737dc4c9f) <small>by Richard Scarsbrook</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-06-18</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

Very entertaining and hard to put down.  I read the entire third act in one sitting, on the eve of Father’s Day, which is interesting considering the plot revelations that come out.

In many instances, the characters surprise you by behaving in ways you don’t expect.  Some characters are set up to be a certain way, but end up making choices that break out of what a clichéd version of the character might do.  For example, in an early scene, the principal of the school, who is also the father of the school bullies, resolves a bullying incident by favouring justice over nepotism.  It took me by surprise, and it was very satisfying.

Overall, a funny and enjoyable read.

### [_The Year of the Flood_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/89c1fc64-269d-477d-bda4-64a86aaab76f) <small>by Margaret Atwood</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-06-20</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

Not as good as _Oryx and Crake_.  I found that switching between two main characters took me out of it.  It’s a bit odd to have one of them narrated in first person, and the other in third person.  I don’t think it serves any great purpose, and it only caused me to have to adjust every time the perspective changed.

My biggest problem with it is that all the minor characters that Jimmy knew and met independently in _Oryx and Crake_ are shown to have a history together in The Year of the Flood.  It was too much of a coincidence and made it seem arbitrary.

### [_A Visit from the Goon Squad_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/27a41ddd-5ed1-439d-beb4-75d54c0bd486) <small>by Jennifer Egan</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-07-06</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

It’s appropriate that I read _Cloud Atlas_ not long ago. That novel and _A Visit from the Goon Squad_ share some similarities in structure: both are essentially a set of short stories, each in a different style, that are all connected in some way.  Ultimately, I have to say that I enjoyed _Cloud Atlas_ more than _Goon Squad_.

The main difference between the two is the purpose that the structure and style serves.  In _Cloud Atlas_, the structure made me curious as to how the stories would end up connecting to each other.  The changes in style worked because they suited the different settings of each story.

In _Goon Squad_, conversely, the structure and style work against the story.  The point-of-view change in each chapter makes it difficult to connect to any one character.  By the time you get to know a character, their story is pretty much over and we’re on to the next one.  It didn’t help that most of the characters were expressing the same dissatisfaction and sadness over getting old.  I know that aging and the passage of time are the themes of the book, but it got a little monotonous because everyone in the story is filled with angst and regret.

I respect Egan’s writing style for the most part; she definitely expresses ideas very creatively.  However, I think she overdoes it in a couple of chapters.  The chapter about Rob is narrated in the second person.  I don’t think there’s any reason for it, other than to do something different.  It’s almost like she wrote it in first person and then simply replaced every “I” with “you.”  I kept forgetting that it was narrated this way and had to reorient myself every time I came across the word “you.”

The other chapter that bothered me was the PowerPoint chapter, supposedly a presentation put together by a 12-year-old girl.  It’s almost a shame because I found the girl’s autistic brother to be interesting.  The brother is obsessed with pauses in songs, and I thought it was a cool concept.  Unfortunately, that distinctive character was masked by the quirky format for the chapter.

Overall, I didn’t really enjoy the book.  I admire the technique and writing style, but the lack of an end-to-end narrative and some overly gimmicky sections took me out of it.

### [_A Game of Thrones_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/021b6c9c-a678-49b7-9a04-93b3c4fc56ae) <small>by George R.R. Martin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-08-06</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I read this after enjoying the TV series.  The book is good, but I must say the TV show does a pretty good job of covering it.  I was able to gloss over some of the more descriptive parts of the book because I had already seen the visual representation and so already had a mental image.

The real test will be when I read the next book, which I want to do before the second season of the show comes out...

### [_The Cult of the Amateur_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7c523bc7-d707-44f3-883e-1ff5ae240518) <small>by Andrew Keen</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-09-22</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

It was good for the first couple of chapters.  I agree that the Internet tends to glorify the participation of the masses, even if those masses produce very little quality.  Keen criticizes Wikipedia in particular, which has made me second-guess my own dependence on that site.  I’ve never used Wikipedia for any in-depth research, but I now worry that even the small factoids that I get from it may not be true.  I think that we are starting to forget the distinction between content created by experts and by amateurs, and this book does a good job reminding us of that.

In the second half, I think the book loses track of its main argument and devolves into moralizing.  It basically boils down to: “The Internet is bad because people get addicted to online poker!  And people steal music!  And there’s too much porn!”  These latter chapters seem disconnected from the original thesis of the book, since these problems aren’t related to the creation of content by amateurs.  While the first part of the book is about the objective quality of content, the second half deals with subjective morals, and it becomes too grounded in the personal values of the author.

Perhaps ironically, the very act of my writing this review (I’m not a professional writer or reviewer) is exactly the kind of thing that this book is arguing against.  So I wonder, can anyone really write a review of this book without having an inherent bias?

### [_A Clash of Kings_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/66465692-f355-4550-b00a-89d5de5ae396) <small>by George R.R. Martin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-10-03</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

Since this series of books is so plot-driven, it's hard to discuss without giving anything away.  I'll just say that I enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to see what happens next.  I'm also very curious about how HBO is going to film this; it's bigger in scope than the first book and has more big action scenes that will be difficult to bring to the screen.  Buy the DVDs, people... they're going to need the money.

### [_The Corrections_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/484fcc35-295f-46b5-b3e0-bad9b682278f) <small>by Jonathan Franzen</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-11-25</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I admired more than enjoyed this book.  It's very well-written, but underneath the impressive style are a story and characters that I didn't like very much.  I thought that it spent too much time in flashback, which gives it the feeling that the current storyline is constantly stalled; I was always waiting for it to get back to what's happening _now_.

### [_The Invention of Hugo Cabret_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1a595c1e-8067-44d4-9f5a-44d06dc4603d) <small>by Brian Selznick</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-02-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

The illustrations were great.  I didn't read all of the text because it's written at a very kid-friendly level and didn't interest me much.  This is one example where the movie works better than the book, mainly because I think it's very important to actually see Méliès films in motion.

### [_The Sisters Brothers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8d5e30dd-f1c7-4f67-9029-e247fefa8c56) <small>by Patrick deWitt</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-06-23</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I don't usually like Westerns, but this was okay.  Had some good dark humour.  The writing style was nice and crisp, but I never felt any real tension in the story.

### [_Oblivion: Stories_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/58bd6573-69e9-4b77-a08f-2ad0bc12b412) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-09-03</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

"Good Old Neon" is worth the price of admission. I'm less impressed with the rest than I was the first time around.

### [_Under the Banner of Heaven_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3472100c-e7d2-4dfb-8561-1b546f66e7b4) <small>by Jon Krakauer</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

A good mix of true crime and history, although I found the true crime bits overly lurid at times.  Also, by focussing so much on the fundamentalist sects of Mormonism and the very negative aspects of these sects, it might be a bit unfair to Mormonism in general.

### [_Cloud Atlas_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/22fe15a2-ddc3-458f-b79c-e740fa8c3f9a) <small>by David Mitchell</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-10-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

Much has been said about the structure of this novel, so I'll try to keep my thoughts on the subject to a minimum. Basically, I don't think that the structure contributes anything to the overall experience beyond providing some "hey, cool" moments where one story references another. Therefore, I see the novel as a set of short stories connected by some common themes rather than a single, grand narrative.  As such, each story should be judged individually.

The one strength that flows throughout the book is the use of language.  Each story takes place in a different setting and time period, which allows Mitchell the opportunity to write in different styles and voices.  I particularly liked the archaic language used in "The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing"--it was challenging but not frustratingly so.  The stories that take place in the future were not as stylistically interesting for me--I've read a lot of sci-fi and the use of invented words has become familiar.

"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish" was the weakest story.  While I did enjoy the character's snarkiness and intelligence, the stakes did not stack up to the more life-and-death situations that the other stories convey.  Maybe it's meant to be a comedic touch to see a curmudgeonly old man overreacting to his plight, but I felt like it didn't fit in with the others.

My favourite story of the lot is "Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After."  Initially, the future-hillbilly language was hard to get into, but it grew on me.  Once I warmed up to it, the innocence of the narrator and his society became evident.  The idea of a primitive post-apocalyptic society, contrasted with the high-tech society of the Prescients, worked really well in building a sense of danger.  In a world that has already lost so much, every action that they take is amplified because of the risk of losing it all.

### [_The Swerve: How the World Became Modern_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d9814d72-f8a8-4011-8155-979a38fe3824) <small>by Stephen Greenblatt</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-03-19</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I liked the parallel and contrasting histories of Ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy, and how the rise of Christianity changed everything.  But when it came to the actual ideas in Lucretius's poem and how those ideas affected the Renaissance, I felt it was kind of rushed and crammed into the final two chapters.

### [_Gone Girl_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e089cca-59c8-48b4-8703-c8d734a79fae) <small>by Gillian Flynn</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-19</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

It was entertaining, but the twists took me out of it.  It got to the point where I couldn't care about the characters anymore because there's no truth to them.

### [_Girl with Curious Hair_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/77029917-5473-461e-b1f0-2307c399329f) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-28</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

Interesting look at his early work and how his style developed.  My favourites were the title story and "John Billy", which both had bizarre narrative voices, something I tend to go for.  The final novella "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way", I had to give up on.  It was more like an essay than a story, and seems to be exactly what Wallace was talking about when he said that everything he wrote when he was younger was him trying to prove that he was clever.

### [_My Friend Dahmer_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ca4a91e5-5019-488d-8c26-91e9c8b4beb6) <small>by Derf Backderf</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-19</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

Artwork is great, but writing is so-so.  The narration in particular is way too direct and unsubtle.

### [_Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/547fb024-de78-43df-bcf3-2415eb3e6865) <small>by Jan Wong</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-09-17</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

Really enjoyed the sense of humour that Wong brought to this memoir.  It really highlights the contradictory and absurd nature of Chinese communism.  But, appropriately, the humour goes out the window during her first-hand account of the Tiananmen Square massacre.  Those few chapters are very powerful indeed.


### [_Consider the Lobster And Other Essays_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/084d5052-0b87-420e-b3eb-0a3cc8f09cd2) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-04-03</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

"Host" and "Up, Simba" were a bit sloppy, I thought, but really enjoyed "Authority and American Usage," especially the part about the pants.

### [_Brief Interviews with Hideous Men_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/06a8534e-8b86-4365-9916-eee5f05d6a1d) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

While I don't expect much in terms of plot from DFW, these stories felt more like a series of rants than actual narratives.  The highlight for me was "Octet."

### [_The Accidental Billionaires_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/792c45f6-3999-4cb8-a20a-e8c6a15f4bb1) <small>by Ben Mezrich</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-10-05</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I didn't realize how closely _The Social Network_ adapted this book. Having just watched the movie, I didn't find that reading the book added much.

### [_The Best Short Stories of the Modern Age_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e869cf33-2168-4e47-9aa5-bf22b0be5928) <small>edited by Douglas Angus</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-08-31</small>

- The Ledge (Hall)
- The Lottery (Jackson)
- Of This Place, Of That Time (Trilling)
- A Clean, Well-Lighted Place (Hemingway)

### [_Rockets Versus Gravity_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cef34ca2-0368-46f1-a97c-4cf6d1f21273) <small>by Richard Scarsbrook</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

(N.B.  I'm a student of the author's and have come to know him personally.)

Very crisp read filled with characters that are easy to identify with.  The morality of the book divides the characters into haves and have-nots, and invariably it's the have-nots who find freedom from their situation, and find value in things other than... things.  Lots of hope.  Lots of humour.

### [_Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3e5c70fe-4896-4c06-b1f1-7574099b1bd1) <small>by Katherine Boo</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-11-29</small>

Nothing evokes guilt like reading about poverty on a brand-new shiny e-book gadget...

Artwork is beautiful. The story seems to be mainly built upon withholding information about the history of the world, so that you want to find out more. I'm not totally invested in the story yet, but the characters are growing on me.

The love triangle kept me engaged, even though Sid was being blindly and irrationally jealous most of the time. There are a couple of beautiful passages about what it's like to make music, and what talent and genius mean. Mostly, though, I never quite settled into the prose style: a bit repetitive at times, and forced my head voice into a mental blackface that I wasn't comfortable with.

Not as much about snooker as I'd hoped. Lots of digressions. Still fun to read.

Highlight: constant bashing of the player Stephen Lee for no apparent reason.

Enjoyed the writing style all around.

Will focus on my favourite story of the bunch, "Dogs In Clothes." The main character reminds me of people I know, egocentric people who like to think of themselves as cultured, and are sensitive to any doubts cast on their sincerity. Yet, the character is not necessarily unlikable. You feel that she is just doing what is expected of her.

### [_A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a99fc975-6ae8-419c-af5b-e83104a5781d) <small>by Dave Eggers</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-24</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

I got the edition that has the "Mistakes We Knew We Made" appendix attached. I skipped it. I had had enough.

It worked for me for the first couple of chapters. The graphic descriptions of the mother's illness ("podules", "green fluids") were an effective, visceral way of gaining sympathy. The sympathy lasts after the parents are gone, when Dave and Toph are living in California. He says "we are owed" and I can give him that, even if I don't believe it. They suffered a tragedy, sure, but they're not the only ones to ever have parents die. The hubris is endearing until the sympathy wears off... by the time we get to Dave's work at the magazine and the extended "interview" with MTV, the overconfident tone became obnoxious to me.

I'm not even mentioning the extended meta-commentary in the acknowledgements at the beginning. Not a good start for me... I was like, really? You're explaining your themes before the book starts?

Excessive worldbuilding... felt like all of the interesting stuff happens "off-screen," at the expense of the present story.

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

The best parts of the book are the passages that connect the writer's life with the killer's. Taken alone, the two stories are interesting, but it's her finding meaning in the parallels between them that is truly compelling.

On a stylistic note, I wasn't a fan of everything in present tense. For a narrative that jumps around in time so much, it's hard to grasp a frame of reference if everything feels like it's happening all at once. I understand that the effect could be intentional, but it jarred me every time she used the _will_ future tense, e.g. "five years from now, I will do so-and-so." But it's obviously all in the past.

### [_Among Others_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/745a42b9-4f46-44e4-9d43-2ab6c9c14f91) <small>by Jo Walton</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-04-18</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

The biggest strength of this novel is the combination of a coming-of-age story with a subtle magical world. The way that magic works, by indirect manipulation of reality, so that a spell seems to reach back in time to set up a chain of events that lead to the desired result, is fascinating. It also plays well with Mori's teenage insecurity; when she makes friends, she doesn't believe that she earned it. Even though she's a clear, natural fit in her book club, she chalks it up to a spell she cast, and agonizes over the "ethics" of her actions.

### [_The Lathe of Heaven_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/be21c17b-5baf-4d4a-b071-908c2eb87ddd) <small>by Ursula K. Le Guin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-04-18</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

The story feels very disorienting, because it jumps between realities, and it's a new world that you have to get used to every time. This is intentional, of course, and effective. However, I felt the need to have some constant to hold onto, and didn't get it. The only relationship that exists throughout the story is between George and Haber. I would have liked to see some sort of evolution in this relationship, like a power struggle that goes back and forth. Instead, I felt that it was quite static: Haber always has the upper hand, and there's not much George can do about it.

### [_The Postmortal_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ccd1cf85-b636-447a-bdc0-1c992b2d1c21) <small>by Drew Magary</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-05-27</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.0" readonly /></span>

The setup and premise are interesting. At first, I got a _World War Z_ vibe because of the "on the ground, as it happened" style. Unfortunately, where _World War Z_ branched out into many different sources and perspectives, here, it's limited to the journal of one person. Because of this, the characters in John's life become vehicles to express how the postmortal cure would affect different slices of society.

E.g.
- The father: an older person.
- The sister: a married person with kids.
- The mother of John's child: a person making the decision to have kids.
- The new girlfriend: a person making the decision to get married.

Nobody feels real, and their conversations often sound like philosophical debates.

### [_Boxers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cde66aec-c19a-4b08-a324-ece042ba8c7a) <small>by Gene Luen Yang</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

I thought the ending was a bit rushed. There's a lot of moral ambiguity here, and I have to say I found it tough to get into because I never really wanted Bao to succeed. His rebellion is based on nationalism and exclusionary thinking, and I couldn't get behind it, even though on a personal level, I respect that he was trying to protect his way of life.

The artwork is great, and I enjoyed the designs of the gods that the fighters become.

### [_Saints_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/01407a14-a384-4334-b961-176821102066) <small>by Gene Luen Yang</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-09</small>

The biggest wow moment for me was seeing the Righteous and Harmonious Fists in battle from Vibiana's perspective. They appear as men, and not as gods. It creates the sense that the Fist members are driven by faith in their cause (which I never totally agreed with while reading _Boxers_).

I was not a fan of the epilogue here... I didn't think that Bao deserved to survive, and especially not due to the prayer that he learned from the girl that he murdered. I didn't feel it was just; Bao was the instigator of violence, and he ends up being victorious, in a way.

### [_Outline_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2cd27b56-150a-4a99-9ad6-eac9e85ce076) <small>by Rachel Cusk</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-12</small>

<span><sl-rating value="5.0" readonly /></span>

I read this while going through a bit of a mid-life crisis. Basically, coming to the realization that it's impossible to have it all. Trying to fit everything into this life only leads to anxiety.

In this book, one character after another pours their heart out to the narrator. They reflect upon their lives, often filled with regret. On the surface, it seems like they regret their failure to attain everything they wanted. But in my state of mind, I interpreted it as regret that they failed to recognize the impossibility of attaining everything they wanted. Or, they failed to recognize that they were being told to want the wrong things.

This book is filled with passages that describe parts of my life perfectly. One of the most emotionally satisfying reads I've had in a while.

### [_Beyond Measure: The Big Impact of Small Changes_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ebc3e612-3a23-4116-8a02-d7d957e19a37) <small>by Margaret Heffernan</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-22</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

Most of it seems common-sense to me: communicate, be social, be open-minded, no hierarchies. I disagree with the pitch that anyone "from the CEO to the janitor" can implement these changes. You still need some power to put things in motion.

<span><sl-rating value="3.0" readonly /></span>

The core message of the book--that people are motivated by doing work that they find meaningful--didn't seem that insightful to me. But I did like the latter half of the book, which talks about how misconceptions spread. Ideology propagates because of self-fulfilling prophecy.

### [_His Dark Materials_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ea810e70-f3f9-4b46-9c3a-5a3fadf7af97) <small>by Philip Pullman</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-01</small>

I liked it less and less as it went on. The first book, I was in, because it focused on one character's quest, and had a sense of discovery as Lyra learned about the rules of the world. There are many strange mysteries, and they all tie into her quest.

By the third book, the world-building and multiple plotlines have gotten so complex that it feels like the characters need to explain what's going on to each other in every other chapter. Lyra spends a third of it asleep, and she's the only character I ever really cared about. (Will is okay, but too brooding.) I found myself rushing through whole sequences, just to get back to her story.

Some subplots I found unsatisfying:
- The war against the Authority doesn't amount to much. We simply haven't seen the Authority do anything to make us want him to lose.
- The assassin sent to kill Mary because she was going to tempt Lyra... he gets killed without the confrontation ever happening.

### [_How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/94ecd827-f0e4-4876-9db5-40c414e039cc) <small>by Jenny Odell</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>

It was well-written and interesting, but focussed too much on art history and literary history, and didn't actually spend a lot of time on the concept of the attention economy itself. I was hoping for more social, technological and historic context.

The best parts for me were those that explored the way that people (families, couples) perform happiness or unity for the sake of others. And then those other people respond with envy, until it breaks down, either because the happiness dissolves for real, or because the envious person realizes that it's only an image.

I didn't like it as much when it dove too deeply into what I would call "writer stuff" - philosophical discussions about the value of literature and writing. It's too self-referential for me.

### [_The New York Trilogy: City of Glass / Ghosts / The Locked Room_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/30ea8154-1db9-4c51-a3a0-5a1a761f5205) <small>by Paul Auster</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-12-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

The linguistic theory stuff in _City of Glass_ reminded me of _Snow Crash_, which is always a good thing. _Ghosts_ was a bit weaker, and felt like a variation of the same themes. But _The Locked Room_ brought it around for me again, by bringing the more abstract ideas of the others into a more personal story.

We become our obsessions, and if our obsession is another person, we risk losing our identity.

More scientific than I expected, as it explains the spread of information and misinformation through precise models. Learned a lot. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there's any way out of the situation unless systems (even the very idea of democracy) fundamentally change. I'm not very hopeful about this; people won't change for the sake of it, unless there are incentives to do so.

I admire the writing. It's filled with both beautiful and horrific images, sometimes stacked together. (E.g., description of grandmother in beautiful dress, at peaceful Buddhist altar; then, the suggestion that the incense blunts the pain that she feels about her departed son.)

On the other hand, I think the lack of structure put me off. I didn't feel attached to any characters because they come and go so quickly that they leave only impressions.

The title essay is brilliant and hilarious.  I have tried to read Wallace's fiction before and always found it a bit depressing.  I think his nonfiction is more grounded in reality and there doesn't go to the same dark places that his fiction does.  I got to appreciate his style more, and I think this will encourage me to revisit his other books.

Towards the end, as the book explores concepts from AI, I lost a bit of interest because I had doubts about whether it's out-dated. AI has progressed greatly since this book was written.

<span><sl-rating value="4.0" readonly /></span>

I was affected more by the large-scale tragedy than by any of the personal suffering of the main characters. The final personal loss did not hit me very hard because I was already numbed by the descriptions of the horrors happening to secondary and background characters, like the beheaded servant, or the malnourished children.

Throughout, I had the sense that the main characters were a bit contrived to be in an optimal position to cover all aspects of the war. For example, Olanna happens to have an ex from the north, who ends up on the opposite side of the war.

The Part 3 section was particularly jarring, an extended flashback focusing on soap opera-like subplots, which interrupts the story of the war.

All in all, despite the flaws in characterization, it was still a powerful account of a period of history that I was ignorant about.

It's simultaneously too long and too short. Too long because it repeats vague descriptions of its ideas multiple times, and too short because it illustrates those ideas with superficial anecdotes. I would have liked to read more about the author's experiences in how he applied these ideas.

I picked up this book after my company hired him to do an interview with our CEO, and I was struck by his charisma. His charm comes through in the book, making it an easy read, but he also deals with South Africa's dark history of racism in a refreshingly blunt way.

Beyond the impact of racism, there's also the huge personal cost of not fitting in with any particular group. He's not Black (though he identifies himself as such), he's not white, and that's hard enough. But there's also the colored people who are the result of race-mixing long ago, before it was illegal. He doesn't fit in with them either, even though he looks like them.

I enjoyed bits of the story, but I don't feel like there's a narrative that drives me to keep reading. In particular, the part about the Lieutenant's war experience in Mongolia was harrowing, and there was a realistic and sensitive discussion on abortion with the wife.

I was also weirded out by some of the sexual stuff... the Creta Kano character is objectified, either as a rape victim or as the subject of wet dreams.

Reminded me a bit of _Flowers for Algernon_ or _The Curious Incident of Dog in Night-time_, due to the narrator’s voice. He’s a naive mind who doesn’t understand the world around him, but cares greatly about being good. Combine that with a cool magical setting, and I was hooked.

### [_On Animals_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b1b032f9-9be1-42cd-8535-ab7b9dbb4631) <small>by Susan Orlean</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-01</small>

The "Free Willy" one was my favourite. It’s disturbing to me that hype around a movie can move so many people to act, without regard to whether it’s really best for the animal.

### [_Gravity's Rainbow_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/98d29db5-5e25-4909-b574-5623778a8b32) <small>by Thomas Pynchon</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-02</small>

This was probably my third attempt. I admire it but don't enjoy it.


### [_Seek You: A Journey Through American Loneliness_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c10d33f5-cb03-40c8-a784-783cf116540a) <small>by Kristen Radtke</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-08</small>

Overall, this book contained a lot of insights about the biological and evolutionary reasons behind human psychology. There's one section, about the US gun problem, which seemed a bit off-topic to me, because it doesn't relate to the main theme of loneliness. It's kind of sad, that the gun issue is so ingrained in American culture that it just has to be commented on.

### [_In the Beginning... Was the Command Line_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0f4ec0a5-cf4c-49ff-99e4-6d1a962b5099) <small>by Neal Stephenson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-09</small>

Picked this up for the first time in ~20 years. I read this many times at an impressionable age, and I credit it for influencing me to start the career path that I'm still on, and further, influencing me to be the type of computer user that I am (a Morlock, in the book's terms). I've internalized so much of the book that I don't feel like I'm really _reading_ it anymore... it's more like, I'm watching sentences go by that are already in my head.

On the other hand, there are some sections that rub me the wrong way now. There's an attitude of elitism that doesn't feel right for me. I know that I was full of conceit and superiority when I was younger, so it would have appealed to me then, but it's kind of abrasive now.

### [_Do Not Say We Have Nothing_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8fb7a723-fa55-4b4d-8575-f22027a3bbe0) <small>by Madeleine Thien</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-21</small>

Had a hard time with the writing style. It felt quite stilted and didn't grip me emotionally. Too many characters introduced too quickly and they didn't feel like real people.

### [_The Year of Magical Thinking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/41e98516-d52e-42b0-8dd9-ee93be8534dc) <small>by Joan Didion</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-02-23</small>

Too sad

### [_A Canticle for Leibowitz_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/320ce5cf-e8ae-42e4-a81d-867d531318e6) <small>by Walter M. Miller Jr.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-02-23</small>

Interesting concepts, but it was too distant from the characters.

### [_Little Blue Encyclopedia (for Vivian)_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/28c70765-7b7c-4b11-b59b-cdc13e37b5ee) <small>by Hazel Jane Plante</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-03-20</small>

A highlight for me in the _Little Blue_ sections was all of the invented titles of other movies or songs.

### [_Dept. of Speculation_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a076c99b-6a76-4a78-a02a-20cec3fcff67) <small>by Jenny Offill</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-06-16</small>

Really liked it until <span class="spoiler" x-data="spoiler" x-bind="attrs">the husband's infidelity</span>. After that point, it got a little chaotic, which I guess is part of the point.

### [_Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/99c9b0f6-04ac-4e76-a10a-d273468caaa2) <small>by Sam Harris</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-07-12</small>

A bit too meandering in getting to its point

### [_Snow Crash_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/af1e9753-9c7c-4d53-9381-bb0c57f51786) <small>by Neal Stephenson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-07-23</small>

An old favourite. This time around, I found myself getting impatient towards the latter half. The first act setup is probably my favourite part, how it creates the setting and introduces the concepts of the Metaverse. As a software guy, I love that "hacking" is like a superpower in the book. Once we get into the long discussions with the Librarian, I started skimming.

### [_The Only Good Indians_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/79437676-42a1-4936-86ac-b885a7f33ac9) <small>by Stephen Graham Jones</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-09-06</small>

Stylistically, it can be a bit hard to follow, but the story is strong and propulsive. The characters are haunted by past actions that are so specific to their culture that at first, I didn't think that what they did was a big deal. But the journey to understanding why it was a big deal for them is exactly why I love reading.

### [_Escape into Meaning: Essays on Superman, Public Benches, and Other Obsessions_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ab30d8cc-c4c8-4776-bc23-3dff690587d4) <small>by Evan Puschak</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-09-25</small>

I’ve watched so much [Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1) that I heard his voice the whole time I was reading this book.

### [_Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7be59bb4-a32b-4a3d-8a2e-041c1fb95b8c) <small>by Annie Dillard</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2023-04-03</small>

I really respect the writing here, but about halfway through, I felt it was getting repetitive.

### [_Version Control_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4b7b5ca6-9939-4022-a95d-288ee150ee65) <small>by Dexter Palmer</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2023-04-03</small>

It's a bit overstuffed, going on a lot of tangents about technology, e.g. social media, online dating, deepfakes/AI. It's all very insightful, but it does distract from the core of the story.
