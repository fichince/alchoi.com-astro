I guess it’s becoming a bit of a New Year’s mini-resolution for me to liberate myself from tech platforms (see [Quoteshelf](/blog/2025-01-13-quoteshelf)). Not that I have anything against the platforms in question, but [it’s always been important to me](/blog/2022-01-04-revive-again) to avoid getting locked into someone else’s website.

Since 2009, the first time I attended [TIFF](/blog/tag/tiff), I’ve been tracking every movie I watch. I think I used to do it on the venerable [IMDB](https://imdb.com), but once [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) came along, I migrated over and never looked back.

A social site like Letterboxd encourages a certain style of writing: pithy and snarky, i.e. like a tweet. I’ve written my fair share of those, with longer reviews residing on my blog. Having my content in two different places just sticks in my craw, so I’ve finally done the somewhat tedious work to export my posts, and have collected them all here in this post.

### [_Upstream Color_](https://letterboxd.com/film/upstream-color/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-08</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Parasitic worms.  Psychic pigs.  This movie has it all.

### [_Room 237_](https://letterboxd.com/film/room-237/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-10</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Fun way to geek out about The Shining.  I wish the different theories were presented in a more organized way, though.

### [_Barry Lyndon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/barry-lyndon/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-12</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Must admit I have a hard time staying interested in the story, but cinematography is amazing.

### [_The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-13</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

Loved the Gollum scenes, disappointed with most everything else.

### [_Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-24</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Hell of a thing, when Spock died...

### [_12 Angry Men_](https://letterboxd.com/film/12-angry-men/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-29</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Makes me want to get picked for jury duty.

### [_Summer Wars_](https://letterboxd.com/film/summer-wars/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-07</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

A great combination of techno-thriller and family drama.  I enjoyed the characters so much that I didn't care how convenient it was that everyone involved in the OZ crisis happens to be in the same family.  Also enjoyed the climactic battle, which threw in (in a self-aware way, I believe) a lot of old anime tropes, e.g. power-up transformation (with wings!), final dramatic super-move (slamming down a playing card!)

### [_Premium Rush_](https://letterboxd.com/film/premium-rush/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-11</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

So but why no brakes??

### [_Star Trek: The Motion Picture_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-the-motion-picture/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-21</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

Never watched this all the way through before, despite my general Trekkiness.  I could tell that they were going for a _2001_ vibe with the deliberate pacing, but the effect is that it feels like a one-hour episode of the show stretched into a two-hour movie.  I was particularly bewildered at the Enterprise "intro scene" where Kirk and Scotty fly up to and dock with the ship in a shuttle... it seems to last 10 minutes, the theme song blaring in a loop the whole time.

### [_Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-v-the-final-frontier/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-24</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

The resolution is unsatisfying, but I thought this had the best Kirk-Spock-Bones bantering of the series... especially the campfire scene.

### [_Star Trek: Generations_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-generations/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

Data's whole thing with the emotion chip was so out of place.  Why would it even be okay for him to install it right in the middle of a critical mission?  And then he just spends the rest of the movie being a total goof.

### [_Star Trek: First Contact_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-first-contact/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-04</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.5" readonly /></span>

It's the best one, plain and simple.

### [_The Grandmaster_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-grandmaster/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-09-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Beautiful action scenes, but I had a lot of problems with the narrative: too much voiceover and text cards, and the sequencing seemed off. Apparently, these issues exist only in the US edit, so I'm very curious to see the original Chinese cut.

### [_Godzilla_](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-2014/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-06-30</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Some great imagery. Wish they had spent more time on Godzilla; he seemed to be always in the background.

### [_Brief Interviews with Hideous Men_](https://letterboxd.com/film/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

It was nice at least to hear DFW's writing spoken as dialogue by great actors (although Krasinski's own scene was a bit lacking); but the film wasn't quite cohesive as a whole.  I felt the same way about the book.

### [_Short Term 12_](https://letterboxd.com/film/short-term-12-2013/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

The scene were Jayden tells the octopus story was quite powerful.  Even though it wasn't clear what the octopus and the shark in the story stood for as she was telling it, the performances were so good that all it mattered was what it meant to both the characters on screen.

### [_Son of Saul_](https://letterboxd.com/film/son-of-saul/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-10</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

The visual strategy of this film was clear from the opening scene: a long extended take, framed as a close-up of the main character, Saul, as he corrals a frightened group of concentration camp prisoners into a gas chamber. He has a stoney expression on his face, and the viewer sees the background only on the edges of the screen, out of focus. I would estimate that 80 - 90% of the film's running time is shot this way, and it serves to put the viewer inside Saul's head. Saul is forcing himself to ignore what he's experiencing because that's the only way he can stay sane, and he gives himself a single-minded goal, to bury the body of a boy, in order to block out the chaos going on around him. As a viewer, you catch glimpses of the horrifying acts of violence happening in the background, as if the film is making you ignore them just like Saul is trying to. But at the same time, the fact that the images are out of focus forces you to look closely, to try to resolve the image in your head, which, when combined with the sounds of the scene, makes it impossible to ignore the atrocity.

### [_The Boy and the Beast_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-beast/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-13</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

I spent the first five minutes thinking that the movie would follow a somewhat conventional martial-arts master-apprentice story: master learns from apprentice much more than vice versa; apprentice is missing a father figure and finds father figure in the master; together, they make each other stronger, and only through their combined strength can they ultimately defeat their adversaries, etc.  And for the most part, the movie is exactly that, and these were the parts I found most enjoyable.  There was an unexpected mid-movie detour where the boy leaves the fantastical beast world which has adopted him and returns to the human world, and he makes a girlfriend and reunites with his missing birth father.  I found this part overly sentimental and dripping with the teenage angst that is my least favourite aspect of much of the anime I see.  Much more entertaining is the comedically dysfunctional relationship between the two title characters, and the visually spectacular fight scenes, i.e. the most predictable parts of this type of movie.  Perhaps I am a sucker for formula.

### [_Embrace of the Serpent_](https://letterboxd.com/film/embrace-of-the-serpent/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-14</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

"They are now the worst of both worlds." That's what Karamakate, an Amazonian man, says of a Catholic missionary, where a mad priest has come under the delusion that he is Christ, and has created a cult-like following of native converts. Karamakate visits the same site twice, once as a young man and again when he is older, and both times, violence arises because of the clash between cultures. This is a dense movie, and the themes are hard to unpack (and would probably require a second viewing to do so), but the feeling of uneasiness arising from the collision between two cultures is always there.

The black and white cinematography made for many memorable shots of the flowing river, where the undulating water is at times closer to black like molasses and at times closer to white like milk.

### [_Cemetery of Splendor_](https://letterboxd.com/film/cemetery-of-splendor/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="1.5" readonly /></span>

Sometimes a guy taking a shit is just a guy taking a shit.

### [_Anomalisa_](https://letterboxd.com/film/anomalisa/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Good customer service requires you to treat every customer as an individual. Not everybody can do this. It's a talent. So what can a common, untalented customer service representative do but learn how to follow a program, a script, a procedure that when you follow it will make the customer feel as if they are being treated as a special, unique individual? The paradox is that our CSRs are all following the same script, the same way to every customer. So but what if you were so good at customer service that you became the expert in the field, and you were the one who creating this script, this procedure, and in the process of creating this thing you saw through the paradox, and knew that you were creating a world where everyone was the same?

### [_Victoria_](https://letterboxd.com/film/victoria-2015/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2" readonly /></span>

It's amazing, how they managed to pull off a long extended single take, and it's an impressive technical achievement, and one wonders how they accomplished certain scenes, like a virtuosic piano performance by the main character Victoria, or a shootout where we see someone get shot and wounded (like, he must have been carrying some sort of vessel of fake blood since the beginning of the movie, or else someone handed it to him while he was off-camera), but then also at the same time, a growing feeling of annoyance and irritation crept in as the film went on, and even though on the surface one is impressed, one wonders why Victoria would hang out with this bunch of jerks, instead of going home already, because some guys are clearly up to no good, it doesn't matter how charming his posturing and lies may be, just go home already, and then also, as if one's dislike of the characters wasn't enough, one also experiences motion sickness because of the constantly moving and shaking camera, so much so that one just wants them to get caught already and get punished for their crime, so that the movie can end, one has to close one's eyes until it ends, because one just wants it to end.

### [_The Whispering Star_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-whispering-star/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-19</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

I was fascinated by this film mainly as a document of the Fukushima region of Japan. Areas that were affected by the tsunami and nuclear plan disaster are now abandoned and isolated, and the film uses these settings to create alien planets where only a few humans survive. Narratively, it's quite episodic and doesn't contain much conflict, but it contained so much beautiful imagery that I was captivated.

### [_The Jungle Book_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-jungle-book-2016/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-04-25</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Favourite lines:
- "That's not a song, that's propaganda!"
- "I nap... a lot."

### [_Abacus: Small Enough to Jail_](https://letterboxd.com/film/abacus-small-enough-to-jail/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-11</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

A family with so much personality and heart that you forget that they are one-percenters, and nothing bad will _really_ happen to them no matter the outcome. But you root for them still. They're not all bad, the rich.

### [_The Red Turtle_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-red-turtle/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-12</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

So pure and simple in its storytelling that it feels like a myth or a parable. Cute crabs.

### [_Voyage of Time: Life's Journey_](https://letterboxd.com/film/voyage-of-time-lifes-journey/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

_Baraka_ and _Samsara_ have done this better, and without the airy narration and questionable CGI. And what's with the muddy cellphone camera footage interspersed throughout? At its best when it sticks to spectacular nature footage a la _Planet Earth_, but then why not just watch that instead?

### [_Salt and Fire_](https://letterboxd.com/film/salt-and-fire/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2" readonly /></span>

What Herzog should do is he should overdub this movie with his own voice. Only he can make this dialogue less awkward and unnatural. Least worst performance: GG Bernal in a tiny comic relief role.

### [_Loving_](https://letterboxd.com/film/loving-2016/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Was hoping for a climactic court room scene but I guess it's not that kind of movie. Was hoping for more drama overall but mood was very subdued, as if trying not to overdramatize it too much in the typical biopic way. Overcompensated perhaps?

### [_Burn Your Maps_](https://letterboxd.com/film/burn-your-maps/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-18</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Cute.  Nice.

### [_Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2017-02-10</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4.5" readonly /></span>

Hard to be objective about this one because of the childhood nostalgia.  This time around, it felt a little too plot-heavy for me... you can tell how much was condensed from the graphic novel (which I would love to read now).  Still visually amazing and thematically rich.

### [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_](https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2017-05-12</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

As funny as expected, but plot is a bit weak. Basically, they meet Kurt Russell, he explains some stuff, and it's nice for a while, until later, when Kurt Russell explains some more stuff, and it's not so nice anymore, and they start fighting.

### [_Phantom Thread_](https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-thread/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-09-01</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

Beautiful film about an ugly relationship.

### [_Loving Vincent_](https://letterboxd.com/film/loving-vincent/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-25</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

Of course, the animation is impressive, but I thought the choice to make the flashbacks in a black-and-white photorealistic style was backwards... shouldn't remembrances of the past be impressionistic and colourful?
The story itself bothered me. Teasing a murder mystery to explain away suicide feels distasteful. Armand interrogated the villagers in a way that could be described as insensitive at best and harassment at worst.

### [_Cosmopolis_](https://letterboxd.com/film/cosmopolis/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-29</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

I've never read DeLillo before, but now I want to. The style of dialogue is right up my alley. Maybe not the most cinematic, but Cronenberg did it a fine job with a seemingly limited budget.

Might be a case of style over substance, though... I didn't think the main character was very compelling, because he just doesn't care about anything. And the attitude of the film was a bit too _male_ for my liking... kind of sex- and gun-happy. The fact that the protagonist's ultimate lesson is symbolized by his prostate says it all.

### [_Black Mirror: Bandersnatch_](https://letterboxd.com/film/black-mirror-bandersnatch/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-30</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2" readonly /></span>

Lacks narrative cohesion, by definition. Too concerned with its own meta-ness...

### [_First Reformed_](https://letterboxd.com/film/first-reformed/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-08</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

I would have liked it a lot more if not for the ending. I had been impressed with the film for not creating romance, especially during the "magical mystery tour" scene. It's rare to see such an intimate moment, without it leading to something sexual. Not every movie must contain coupling. That's why the ending disappointed me. I would have liked to see Toller deal with his problems in his own right, without falling back on the easy solution that all he needed was love.

I did enjoy the exploration of religion and environmentalism. What I thought would be a film about a man losing his faith, instead became an argument for faith being a tool to strengthen a worldly philosophy. It almost made me, a non-religious man, want to join a church. Almost.

Best scene came early: the first conversation between Toller and Michael. Intensely emotional performances.

### [_Call Me by Your Name_](https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-11</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

The reason I know this movie didn't work for me is because I had almost no reaction to the final shot. I should have been bawling.

I think the movie waited too long (until maybe the last three scenes) to have its characters actually express what they feel. Before that, motivations seem vague, and a lot of the dialogue feels like variations of "why?" "just because"

### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-13</small>

<span><sl-rating value="5" readonly /></span>

I miss when movies looked like this. Film grain galore, not all shiny, CG effects that weren't in your face. I think this trilogy was made at the perfect time in the history of film technology.

This one has always been my favourite. It's got the most adventure, and it shows you so many new things. The extended battle scenes that define the other two were always a little boring to me. Gonna revisit the rest of the series in the next couple days. Can't wait.

### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-14</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

What I think is my least favourite of the three, to be confirmed tomorrow.

Visually, much more drab and grey than the first. Thematically, more of a war movie than an adventure.

A messy climax, jumping between two or three battles at once.

The Gimli comedy feels one-note.

"Gollum's Song" is my favourite piece of music to come from this trilogy.

### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-15</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Balances the adventure of the first with the war movie elements of the second. The story is better integrated into the battle than in Two Towers.

### [_Far from the Tree_](https://letterboxd.com/film/far-from-the-tree-2017/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-16</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Positive message of love and acceptance. Just made me happy.

### [_The Big Sick_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-sick/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-17</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

A timeless romance between a guy and a girl...'s parents...

I do wish we'd seen Kumail and Emily's relationship (re)develop after the titular Sick. Chemistry between characters was great all around.

### [_Predestination_](https://letterboxd.com/film/predestination/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-18</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

Somebody please draw me a diagram

### [_Bumblebee_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bumblebee/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-19</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

Almost tried a little too hard in its un-Baying.

### [_Fyre_](https://letterboxd.com/film/fyre-2019/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-20</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Entertaining to watch in a trainwreck kind of way, but kind of disturbing by the end. I hope there is justice for everyone involved, especially the local workers who didn't get paid.

Makes me wonder how a person like Billy comes to exist. Can they make a prequel about his childhood?

### [_Shirkers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/shirkers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-20</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Enjoyed the colourful footage from the past. Felt really bad for the filmmakers for having their hard work stolen from them.

One thing I had trouble with was how _Shirkers_ (the documentary) seems to take for granted that _Shirkers_ (the indie film) would have been in some way historically significant. How do we know that? I don't think this documentary needed that stance, as a story about a personal loss (not necessarily a cultural one) would be compelling enough.

P.S. watching this on the same day as FYRE made for an inadvertent "Male Egotist Taking Advantage of His Position of Power" double feature.

### [_Blade Runner 2049_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner-2049/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-21</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

Some highlights for me:

- Sometimes, on the soundtrack, there's an electronic buzz that sounds like motorcycles revving. Could be part of the score, could be part of background noise. Very cool.

- The scene where Luv interrogates the Lieutenant... Luv is the aggressor, and has the upper hand, but in the middle of yelling, sheds a couple of tears. I think it might have been accidental, the actress just getting overwhelmed by the scene, but it works to show how emotionally unstable that character is.

Unfortunately, I didn't think the story was successful overall. I wanted to just enjoy the visuals, and I did, but often found myself being distracted by questions arising from the plot.

### [_Eighth Grade_](https://letterboxd.com/film/eighth-grade/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-23</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

There's not much nuance here. When you see the boy you like, a loud electronic soundtrack will play. When you explore your sexuality, your dad will walk in. When you feel down, there will be a voiceover of yourself, giving a motivational speech.

Some of the sincere moments near the end redeemed it, but I spent the first half of the movie feeling weary about the sustained cringe.

### [_Black Panther_](https://letterboxd.com/film/black-panther/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-23</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

The rare MCU film which improves in second viewing. Noticed the depth of performances this time around.

### [_Nothing Like a Dame_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nothing-like-a-dame/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-26</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

I might not be British enough for this

### [_Three Identical Strangers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/three-identical-strangers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-31</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2.5" readonly /></span>

I was excited to watch this, but turned out a bit disappointing for me. I thought the movie tried too hard to create shock. Twin studies are common, and not that shocking in itself. The film could have done more to explore the ethical implications of non-consensual separation (this is the truly shocking part), but gets too caught up in editing tricks, trying to make the very existence of scientific experimentation into a plot twist.

I also had problems with the stuff near the end, when the movie tries to hurriedly weigh in on the nature-vs.-nurture debate. The film has sat on the nature side of the fence for most of its runtime, but decides to flip-flop at the end, towards the nurture side. The effect is that the dead triplet's adoptive father, who has not had much screentime up to this point, suddenly gets turned into a scapegoat. It was not a fair treatment of the issue, in my opinion. I would have preferred a more balanced approach, instead of saving one side of the argument to the end as a kind of forced catharsis.

### [_Pope Francis: A Man of His Word_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-03</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

I enjoyed listening to him talk. He's got a gentle, wise way of speaking. I'm not Catholic or religious, but I'm glad to see a religious leader embracing change, and spreading a message of equality and environmental stewardship.

The film does well to convey the Pope's message, but left me a bit frustrated because I wanted to see how his message translates into action. What can the church do to address the issues that he talks about, beyond making speeches? How do members of the church act upon the Pope's leadership?

### [_Sorry to Bother You_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sorry-to-bother-you/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-08</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

I found it a little messy, and the humour was hit or miss.

E.g., hits:
- the interminable security code in the elevator
- the Cash and Sal "you smell nice" staredown

E.g., misses:
- Squeeze and his bullhorn STD rant - kind of deflated the emotion of that scene
- forced rapping at the party - ended with a somewhat obvious joke

Then there's the big twist. I grant that it worked viscerally, almost like a horror movie reveal. But in terms of character, having that be the catalyst for Cash's redemption cheapens it. After being tempted into a morally bankrupt Power Caller position--by wealth, by glamour, by prestige--I wanted him to return to the "good side" via some kind of internal conflict. Instead, he's confronted with a proposal that no one in their right mind would accept.

### [_A Dog's Purpose_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-dogs-purpose/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-10</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2" readonly /></span>

As an unabashed dog lover, I can't _not_ enjoy a movie like this, purely on a look-at-the-cute-puppies level.

Of course, I know full well the narrative failures of this story. Its use of reincarnation as a premise doesn't mesh with my philosophy; to me, each reincarnated life should be an equal part of the whole, a segment of an infinite cycle. In this movie, the life with Ethan has the most significance. It makes it feel like the lives in the middle (as police dog Ellie, and family dog Tino) were just shoved in there to get Ethan to the appropriate age for Dennis Quaid. They don't add anything to the story, and the death scenes, which can't _not_ be sad, don't feel earned because we haven't spent enough time with those characters.

Enjoyable performances all around, especially Lewis Pullman and Cynthia Erivo.

A couple of characters could have used more development. Cult leaders and members are not necessarily murderous psychopaths. Why were Rose and Billy the way they were?

Stylistically, it was cool (even though there were a few too many lingering filler shots). I dug the droning horror movie soundtrack.

Ultimately, I couldn't buy that Lily would actually go through with her plan. She hasn't shown that she's the type of person who would do that. I know that's supposed to be the point, that she's the truly psychopathic one, and not Amanda; but I just didn't believe it.

Effectively unsettling and disturbing. Loved the unusual scene where Joe and a henchman sing a song while henchman dies. Elements of _Taxi Driver_ and _Top of the Lake_, the latter in particular because of the "Powerful Men are Behind the Pedophilia Ring" trope. In both cases, the twist is just given without further explanation. It troubles me a little that writers expect audiences to accept this kind of twist so easily.

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

There's a couple of scenes where Maria seems to display superhuman strength. (Jumps off a moving train... runs off unharmed. Jumps out a second storey window... runs off unharmed.) Is this supposed to show that she's under divine protection?

Other than this one oddity, I didn't find much depth to the story. I wanted to see more of what Maria actually believed. We seem to take for granted that cult leaders are evil... what makes them do what they do?

### [_Bombay Rose_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bombay-rose/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-08</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

Lovely animation, which allows characters to shift between (day)dreams and reality. The best visual touch was when the teacher walks through the streets, and the busy buildings transform into smaller structures from the past, while the whole image fades into black and white.

I was expecting a romance, but actually, the two leads don't even talk to each other until near the end. Their romance is built entirely on glances and gestures. That's okay, though, because there are plenty of side characters (the teacher, the grandfather, the street kid), and the interconnected stories pay off well.

Could have ended one scene earlier, on the toilet. The sound of her laughing and crying at the same time would have been a powerful and emotionally ambiguous cut to black.

The second film I've watched recently (after _Mountains May Depart_) featuring the young-student-sleeps-with-older-chinese-teacher-and-later-someone-mistakes-him-for-her-son trope.

### [_A Hidden Life_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-hidden-life-2019/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>

<span><sl-rating value="3.5" readonly /></span>

It took me some time to get into the rhythm, but I think I got there in the end. I wish the main character had spoken more... it felt like many scenes consisted of his peers angrily yelling rhetorical questions at him ("What of your family? Do you think your actions will change anything? What is this for?"), and he just paces and stares back. He has the answers but doesn't speak them. August Diehl did a Q&A after the screening and he said that he was going for a silent resistance. I get the sentiment, but it frustrated me a bit.

### [_Henry Glassie: Field Work_](https://letterboxd.com/film/henry-glassie-field-work/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>

<span><sl-rating value="4" readonly /></span>

For the first half hour, the film is simply watching Brazilian artists make stuff. I was thinking, this is cool, but you gotta give me some information and some context. Thankfully, the film does, and when Glassie speaks, he's full of wisdom about art and humanity. (To paraphrase, "art is the reconciliation between being both alone and a part of society.") For the final third, the film reverts again to just watching pottery makers work. By that time, all of my impatience was gone... I understood that what Henry Glassie does is all about observation, and I wanted to be a part of it.

<span><sl-rating value="3" readonly /></span>

I liked the positive attitude of the film; most of the characters around Maryam are supportive. On the other hand, it didn't feel like there was much conflict beyond the obvious gender segregation and discrimination. In particular, the subplot with the father's touring band didn't do much more than providing some nice musical interludes. The director said that she added music for her ailing mother, so I'll let it slide.

### [_No. 7 Cherry Lane_](https://letterboxd.com/film/no-7-cherry-lane/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-10</small>

<span><sl-rating value="2" readonly /></span>

First, the visuals. There is beauty in the still frames, but as soon as the characters start moving, it feels unnatural. They move too slowly and stiffly.

The story was a mess. First half was okay, and I could buy into the relationship between Fan and Mrs. Yu. But then it makes a sharp turn, and he's suddenly going out with the daughter instead. I couldn't understand what each character wanted after that.

The two dream sequences are troubling, too... the first makes rape erotic, and the second makes queerness creepy.

The only thing I wish was different is the fact that they're showbiz people... that makes it hard for me to personally relate to.

The most amazing image was the "infinite" airport, with crowds of people dragging luggage carts towards the desks. The privileged, trying to escape with their wealth, after literally destroying a young person's future.
