quotes:
  - It's your experience while growing up, I believe, that shapes the direction
    of your life. A basic image of the world is planted deep in your mind, and
    then, like a document in a copy machine, it keeps being reprinted again and
    again throughout your formative years. Once you reach adulthood, whether
    you're successful or not, whatever you accomplish can only partially revise
    that most basic image; it will never be entirely transformed. Naturally some
    revise the image more and some revise it less. Mao Zedong, I'm sure, made
    more revisions than I have done.
  - "I began to search my conscience: why was I always dreamìng at night of
    being hunted down and killed? Surely it was the result of my writing so much
    about violence and bloodletting during the day. A karmic law of cause and
    effect was at work, I became convinced. And so in the hollow of the
    night—the early hours of the morning, perhaps—under quilt damp with cold
    sweat I issued myself a dire warning: You've got to stop writing this kind
    of story."
  - This remorse left a profound mark, and it has stayed with me through all my
    years as an author. It is when the suffering of others becomes part of my
    own experience that I truly know what it is to live and what it is to write.
    Nothing in the world, perhaps, is so likely to forge a connection between
    people as pain, because the connection that comes from that source comes
    from deep in the heart. So when in this book I write of China's pain, I am
    registering my pain too, because China's pain is mine.
  - "Some Western intellectuals take the view that an economy can enjoy rapid
    growth only in a society where the political system is fully democratic.
    They find it astonishing that in a nation where politics is far from
    transparent the economy can develop at such an impressive pace. But they are
    overlooking, I think, a crucial point: behind China's economic miracle there
    is a pair of powerful hands pushing things along, and their owner's name is
    Revolution."
  - After 1949, when the Communist Party came to power, it steadily maintained
    its commitment to carry out revolution to the fullest. At that point, of
    course, revolution no longer meant armed struggle so much as a series of
    political movements, each hot on the heels of the one before, reaching
    ultimate extremes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.
    Later, when China reintroduced itself to the world in the guise of a
    freewheeling, market-driven economy, revolution appeared to have vanished.
    But in our economic miracle since 1978, revolution never disappeared but
    simply donned a different costume.
  - So China moved from Mao Zedong's monochrome era of politics-in-command to
    Deng Xiaoping's polychrome era of economics above all. "Better a socialist
    weed than a capitalist seedling," we used to say in the Cultural Revolution.
    Today we can't tell the difference between what is capitalist and what is
    socialist—weeds and seedlings come from one and the same plant.
  - "After Tiananmen, however, political reform ground to a halt, while the
    economy began breakneck development. Because of this paradox we find
    ourselves in a reality full of contradictions: conservative here, radical
    there; the concentration of political power on this side, the unfettering of
    economic interests on that; dogmatism on the one hand, anarchism on the
    other; toeing the line here, tossing away the rule book there. Over the past
    twenty years our development has been uneven rather than comprehensive, and
    this lopsided development is compromising the health of our society."
  - It seems to me that the emergence—and the unstoppable momentum—of the
    copycat phenomenon is an inevitable consequence of this lopsided
    development. The ubiquity and sharpness of social contradictions have
    provoked a confusion in people's value systems and worldview, thus giving
    birth to the copycat effect, when all kinds of social emotions accumulate
    over time and find only limited channels of release, transmuted constantly
    into seemingly farcical acts of rebellion that have certain
    anti-authoritarian, anti-mainstream, and anti-monopoly elements. The force
    and scale of copycatting demonstrate that the whole nation has taken to it
    as a form of performance art.

    In China today, in some spheres there is still a lack of freedom, while in
    others there is so much freedom it's hard to believe. More than twenty years
    ago I could say whatever came into my head when I was interviewed by a
    journalist, but the interview would undergo strict review and be drastically
    edited before publication; ten years ago I began to be more circumspect in
    interviews, because I discovered that newspapers would report everything I
    said, even my swear words; and now I am often amazed to read interviews I
    have never given—remarks that the reporter has simply concocted, a gushing
    stream of drivel attributed to me. Once I ran into a reporter who had
    fabricated just such an interview and I told him firmly, "I have never been
    interviewed by you, ever."


    He responded just as firmly: "That was a copycat interview."
  - "“The arrow hits the target, leaving the string,\" Dante wrote, and by
    inverting cause and effect he impresses on us how quickly an action can
    happen. In China's breathtaking changes during the past thirty years we
    likewise find a pattern of development where the relationship between cause
    and effect is turned on its head. Practically every day we find ourselves
    surrounded by consequences, but seldom do we trace these outcomes back to
    their roots. The result is that conflicts and problems—which have sprouted
    everywhere like weeds during these past decades—are concealed amid the
    complacency generated by our rapid economic advances. My task here is to
    reverse normal procedure: to start from the effects that seem so glorious
    and search for their causes, whatever discomfort that may entail."
  - The rapid rise in popularity of the word "bamboozle," like that of
    "copycat," demonstrates to me a breakdown of social morality and a confusion
    in the value system in China today; it is an aftereffect of our uneven
    development these past thirty years. If anything, bamboozling is even more
    widespread in social terms than the copycat phenomenon, and when bamboozling
    gains such wide acceptance, it goes to show that we live in a frivolous
    society, one that doesn't set much store by matters of principle.

    Many Chinese have begun to pine for the era of Mao Zedong, but I think the
    majority of them don't really want to go back in time and probably just feel
    nostalgic. Although life in the Mao era was impoverished and restrictive,
    there was no widespread, cruel competition to survive, just empty class
    struggle, for actually there were no classes to speak of in those days and
    so struggle mostly took the form of sloganeering and not much else. People
    then were on an equal level, all alike in their frugal lifestyles; as long
    as you didn't stick your neck out, you could get through life quite
    uneventfully.


    China today is a completely different story. So intense is the competition
    and so unbearable the pressure that, for many Chinese, survival is like war
    itself.
  - When the world is ailing, revolutionary impulses are stirred, just as when
    the body is ailing, inflammation ensues.
