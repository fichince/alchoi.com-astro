title: Man's Search for Meaning
author: Viktor E. Frankl
quotes:
  - "On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of
    trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for
    existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even
    brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save
    themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or
    miracles—whatever one may choose to call them—we know: the best of us did
    not return."
  - I think it was Lessing who once said, “There are things which must cause you
    to lose your reason or you have none to lose.” An abnormal reaction to an
    abnormal situation is normal behavior.

    The corpse which had just been removed stared in at me with glazed eyes. Two
    hours before I had spoken to that man. Now I continued sipping my soup.

      If my lack of emotion had not surprised me from the standpoint of professional interest, I would not remember this incident now, because there was so little feeling involved in it.
  - I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow
    prisoner, who threw himself about in his sleep, obviously having a horrible
    nightmare. Since I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered
    from fearful dreams or deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I
    drew back the hand which was ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I
    was about to do. At that moment I became intensely conscious of the fact
    that no dream, no matter how horrible, could be as bad as the reality of the
    camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about to recall him.
  - Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult
    external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually
    beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp's difficulties as a test of their
    inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as
    something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live
    in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.
  - "The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous
    light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet
    it is possible to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp,
    although suffering is omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man's suffering is
    similar to the behavior of gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into
    an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter
    how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and
    conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little.
    Therefore the \"size\" of human suffering is absolutely relative."
  - "An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize
    values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the
    opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature.
    But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both
    creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral
    behavior: namely, in man's attitude to his existence, an existence
    restricted by external forces. A creative life and a life of enjoyment are
    banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If
    there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in
    suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and
    death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete."
  - The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails,
    the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even
    under the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life.
    It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for
    self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an
    animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the
    opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may
    afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
  - When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept
    his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to
    acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the
    universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place.
    His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.
  - Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we
    may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is
    past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being,
    and perhaps the surest kind.
  - Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of
    tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one
    still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one
    should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore
    is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant
    about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is
    only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I
    consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what
    man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology,
    "homeostasis," i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a
    tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile
    goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at
    any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.
