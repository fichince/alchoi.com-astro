title: China's New Youth
author: Alec Ash
quotes:
  - "When Xiaoxiao started middle school, everything changed. Her dolls were
    taken away, TV was restricted and the fruit storeroom she played in became
    off bounds. The shift was so sudden that Xiaoxiao remembers thinking she was
    being punished for an unknown crime. Overnight, the pampering she was used
    to transformed into the true legacy of the only-child generation: crippling
    study pressure. Early childhood is a protected time, but the fairy tale
    crumbles as soon as you are old enough to hit the books twelve hours a day.
    'Knowledge changes destiny,' Xiaoxiao's mother used to tell her at dinner, a
    familiar saying."
