quotes:
  - “They're not blind or deaf. They'll eventually feel the envy from people
    right here in the town who see themselves as also in dire need but who were
    never given a free house or car. They'll see that Canadians aren't
    necessarily all as warm and cuddly as we're currently making ourselves out
    to be. And still, they'll forever have to be expressing how grateful they
    are to us."
  - That's what it is to live in a family. Constant negotiation. Perhaps it's
    true that all good things are bound to come to an end. Entropy. The law of
    physics. All things fall apart. But things also go in cycles, of course.
    Gravity. Decline. Disintegration. And then renewal. The process toward
    disintegration beginning always in renewal, and renewal preceding *and*
    following disintegration.
  - We've been living together almost half a dozen years, but there are times I
    look at Alex's face in repose and realize I have no idea what goes on in her
    head unless she actually tells me. And if I were to ask her what is on her
    mind, how do I know if what she'd tell me is the truth? I can't know. And
    vice versa. We just have to trust. Or believe. There's a difference between
    these two, isn't there? I wonder what she really sees of me that she doesn't
    say out loud.
  - "\"I guess that's the thing about getting older, isn't it?\" Alex said. We'd
    been chatting, just days ago, pleasantly at last, as if all was well between
    us, and then she came at it from what she might have thought of as slightly
    higher ground: \"We start searching for anyone and everyone we used to know
    in our younger days. That's what social media has done to us. It makes us
    imagine we can create this expansive story, this full picture, of our lives,
    stitch every single recorded moment of our pasts and presents together
    seamlessly. Everyone's an artist these days, creating self-portraits,
    portraits via social media of their world.\""
  - During the decades when our friendship ebbed and flowed in the natural,
    uncontrived way that it did, I'd not really bothered myself too much about
    the whys and whereofs of it. But in the last few years, after the
    intentionality of the distancing, whenever he'd come to mind, something
    welled up, making me a little ill, remorseful. I noticed at some point that
    I have a tendency to hum a single note whenever I think of him. It is not
    exactly a pleasant sound but more like a sound meant to hide a groan. This
    strange, sudden, and involuntary emission is a chord made up of the notes of
    regret, remorse, and guilt. So perhaps my need to get on with a visit with
    him is not really out of the blue. What is out of the blue is the
    recognition of this pending visit as a chance to clean up an aspect of my
    life—a chance to scrub karma, or something like that.
  - It's possible, at least in the very grand scheme of things, that thoughts
    are more material than they are ephemeral, like radio or energy waves, and
    must necessarily leave our brains, and when they do they float out into the
    universe. If so, then a googolplexian of thoughts—oh, way more than that, a
    googolplexian times a googolplexian of one-word thoughts, novel-length
    thoughts, unfinished thoughts, all, this minute, are criss-crossing the
    universe, each carried in a microscopic elastic bubble of something like an
    invisible gas or whatever medium might surround and preserve it. The bubbles
    are so small, smaller than a proton, that no invented microscope could see
    them as they slam into each other, and although they do so, no bubble is
    ever punctured because the gas or oil that preserves them is also slippery.
    They float bump slip slide float and bump again until they arrive at the
    head of the person or persons to whom they pertain. Perhaps they
    buzz—without an actual buzz sound, of course, perhaps more like a
    vibration—waiting for their intended receptor to tune in, to undo the latch,
    open the mind, and catch them.
  - The feeling of jealousy, as long as its causes are not wounding, affect a
    delightful flame in me. This provocation and playfulness of feigned
    jealousies was a shared trait, a sensibility, that attracted us to each
    other.
  - Time came and went, and if anything changed it was my heart. It toughened.
    An enormous amount of energy is required for a heart to toughen, and in the
    end it's draining.
