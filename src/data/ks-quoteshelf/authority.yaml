quotes:
  - “We live in a universe driven by chance," his father had said once, "but the
    bullshit artists all want causality." Bullshit artist in this context meant
    his mother, but the statement had wide applications.
  - "There came a distant shout across the river, and an even-more distant
    reply. Something small snuffled and quorked its way through the reeds to his
    right. A deep breath of fresh air was limned by a faint but sharp marsh
    smell. It was the kind of place where he and his father would have gone
    canoeing when he was a teenager. It wasn't true wilderness, was comfortingly
    close to civilization, but existed just enough apart to create a boundary.
    This was what most people wanted: to be *close to* but not *part of*. They
    didn't want the fearful unknown of a \"pristine wilderness.\" They didn't
    want a soulless artificial life, either."
  - In college, what had always stuck him in Astronomy 101 was that the first
    astronomers to think of points of light not as part of a celestial tapestry
    revolving around the earth but as individual stars had had to wrench their
    imaginations—and thus their analogies and metaphors—out of a grooved track
    that had been running through everyone's minds for hundreds and hundreds of
    years.
