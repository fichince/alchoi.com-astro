title: Reading Like a Writer
author: Francine Prose
quotes:
  - Like seeing a photograph of yourself as a child, encountering handwriting
    that you know was once yours but that now seems only dimly familiar can
    inspire a confrontation with the mystery of time.
  - Not long ago, a friend told me that her students had complained that reading
    masterpieces made them feel stupid. But I've always found that the better
    the book I'm reading, the smarter I feel, or, at least, the more able I am
    to imagine that I might, someday, _become_ smarter. I've also heard fellow
    writers say that they cannot read while working on a book of their own, for
    fear that Tolstoy or Shakespeare might influence them. I've always _hoped_
    they would influence me, and I wonder if I would have taken so happily to
    being a writer if it had meant that I couldn't read during the years it
    might take to complete a novel.
