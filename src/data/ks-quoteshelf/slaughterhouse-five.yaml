title: Slaughterhouse-Five
author: Kurt Vonnegut
quotes:
  - I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part
    in massacres, and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them
    with satisfaction or glee.
  - Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present,
    and the future.
  - There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it
    contained no nourishment whatsoever.
  - Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to
    make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by,
    and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame
    themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful,
    who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any
    other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.
  - On Tralfamadore, says Billy Pilgrim, there isn’t much interest in Jesus
    Christ. The Earthling figure who is most engaging to the Tralfamadorian
    mind, he says, is Charles Darwin—who taught that those who die are meant to
    die, that corpses are improvements. So it goes.
