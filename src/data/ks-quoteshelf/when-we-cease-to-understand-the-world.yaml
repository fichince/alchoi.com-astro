title: When We Cease to Understand the World
author: Benjamin Labatut
quotes:
  - "[The night gardener] had also gone through a bad divorce, become estranged
    from his only daughter and been diagnosed with skin cancer, but he insisted
    that all of that, however painful, was secondary to the sudden realization
    that it was mathematics—not nuclear weapons, computers, biological warfare
    or our climate  Armageddon—which was changing our world to the point where,
    in a couple of decades at most, we would simply not be able to grasp what
    being human really meant."
  - Take quantum mechanics, the crown jewel of our species, the most accurate,
    far-ranging and beautiful of all our physical theories. It lies behind the
    supremacy of our smartphones, behind the Internet, behind the coming promise
    of godlike computing power. It has completely reshaped our world. We know
    how to use it, it works as if by some strange miracle, and yet there is not
    a human soul, alive or dead, who actually gets it. The mind cannot come to
    grips with its paradoxes and contradictions. It's as if the theory had
    fallen to earth from another planet, and we simply scamper around it like
    apes, toying and playing with it, but with no true understanding.
  - "The night gardener once asked me if I knew how citrus trees died: when they
    reach old age, if they are not cut down and they manage to survive drought,
    disease and innumerable attacks of pests, fungi and plagues, they succumb
    from overabundance. When they come to the end of their life cycle, they put
    out a final, massive crop of lemons. In their last spring their flowers bud
    and blossom in enormous bunches and fill the air with a smell so sweet that
    it stings your nostrils from two blocks away; then their fruits ripen all at
    once, whole limbs break off due to their excessive weight, and after a few
    weeks the ground is covered with rotting lemons. It is a strange sight, he
    said, to see such exuberance before death. One can picture it in animal
    species, those million salmon mating and spawning before dropping dead, or
    the billions of herrings that turn the seawater white with their sperm and
    eggs and cover the coasts of the northeast Pacific for hundreds of miles.
    But trees are very different organisms, and such displays of overripening
    feel out of character for a plant and more akin to our own species, with its
    uncontrolled, devastating growth. I asked him how long my own citrus had to
    live. He told me that there was no way to know, at least not without cutting
    it down and looking inside its trunk. But, really, who would want to do
    that?"
  - If matter were prone to birthing monsters of this kind, Schwarzschild asked
    with a trembling voice, were there correlations with the human psyche? Could
    a sufficient concentration of human will—millions of people exploited for a
    single end with their minds compressed into the same psychic space—unleash
    something comparable to the singularity?
