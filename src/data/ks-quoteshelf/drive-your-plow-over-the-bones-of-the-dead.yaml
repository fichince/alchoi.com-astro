title: Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead
author: Olga Tokarczuk
quotes:
  - I am already at an age and additionally in a state where I must always wash
    my feet thoroughly before bed, in the event of having to be removed by an
    ambulance in the Night.
  - He was always up to a bit of stealing, filching, fiddling, to make himself
    extra cash; when the summer residents left a torch or a pair of pruning
    shears in the yard, Big Foot would instantly nose out an opportunity to
    swipe these items, which he could then sell off in town. In my view he
    should have received several Punishments by now, or even been sent to
    prison. I don't know how he got away with it all. Perhaps there were some
    angels watching over him; sometimes they turn up on the wrong side.
  - To my mind, Death should be followed by the annihilation of matter. That
    would be the best solution for the body. Like this, annihilated bodies would
    go straight back into the black holes whence they came. The Souls would
    travel at the speed of light into the light. If such a thing as the Soul
    exists.
  - Cautiously I unwound the repulsive foot wrappings, and saw his feet. They
    astonished me. I have always regarded the feet as the most intimate and
    personal part of our bodies, and not the genitals, not the heart, or even
    the brain, organs of no great significance that are too highly valued. It is
    in the feet that all knowledge of Mankind lies hidden; the body sends them a
    weighty sense of who we really are and how we relate to the earth. It's in
    the touch of the earth, at its point of contact with the body that the whole
    mystery is located — the fact that we're built of elements of matter, while
    also being alien to it, separated from it. The feet — those are our plugs
    into the socket. And now those naked feet gave me proof that his origin was
    different. He couldn't have been human. He must have been some sort of
    nameless form, one of the kind that — as Blake tells us — melts metals into
    infinity, changes order into chaos. Perhaps he was a sort of devil. Devilish
    creatures are always recognized by their feet — they stamp the earth with a
    different seal.
  - It was hard to have a conversation with Oddball. He was a man of very few
    words, and as it was impossible to talk, one had to keep silent. It's hard
    work talking to some people, most often males. I have a Theory about it.
    With age, many men come down with testosterone autism, the symptoms of which
    are a gradual decline in social intelligence and capacity for interpersonal
    communication, as well as a reduced ability to formulate thoughts. The
    Person beset by this Ailment becomes taciturn and appears to be lost in
    contemplation. He develops an interest in various Tools and machinery, and
    he's drawn to the Second World War and the biographies of famous people,
    mainly politicians and villains. His capacity to read novels almost entirely
    vanishes; testosterone autism disturbs the character's psychological
    understanding. I think Oddball was suffering from this Ailment.
  - I find the satellite pictures and the curvature of the Earth very moving. So
    is it true that we live on the surface of a sphere, exposed to the gaze of
    the planets, left in a great void, where after the Fall the light was
    smashed to smithereens and blown apart? It is true. We should remember that
    every day, for we do tend to forget. We believe we are free, and that God
    will forgive us. Personally I think otherwise. Finally, transformed into
    tiny quivering photons, each of our deeds will set off into Outer Space,
    where the planets will keep watching it like a film until the end of the
    world.
  - The Writer usually drove down in May, in a car packed to the roof with books
    and exotic foods. I would help her to unload it, because she had a bad back.
    She went about in an orthopaedic collar; it seems she had had an accident in
    the past. Or perhaps her spine was ruined by writing. She looked like a
    survivor from Pompeii — as if she were entirely coated in ash. Her face was
    ash-grey, including her lips, and her eyes were grey, and so was her long
    hair tightly gathered into a small bun on the top of her head. If I hadn't
    known her so well, I'm sure I would have read her books. But as I did know
    her, I was afraid to open them. What if I found myself described in them in
    a way that I couldn't fathom? Or my favourite places, which for her are
    something completely different from what they are to me? In a way, people
    like her, those who wield a pen, can be dangerous. At once a suspicion of
    fakery springs to mind — that such a Person is not him or herself, but an
    eye that's constantly watching, and whatever it sees it changes into
    sentences; in the process it strips reality of its most essential quality —
    its inexpressibility.
  - One must keep one's eyes and ears open, one must know how to match up the
    facts, see similarity where others see total difference, remember that
    certain events occur at various levels or, to put it another way, many
    incidents are aspects of the same, single occurrence. And that the world is
    a great big net, it is a whole, where no single thing exists separately;
    every scrap of the world, every last tiny piece, is bound up with the rest
    by a complex Cosmos of correspondences, hard for the ordinary mind to
    penetrate. That is how it works. Like a Japanese car.

    I must be very careful. Now I shall dare to say this: I'm not a good
    Astrologer, unfortunately. There's a flaw in my character that obscures the
    image of the distribution of the planets. I look at them through my fear,
    and despite the semblance of cheerfulness that people naively and
    ingenuously ascribe to me, I see everything as if in a dark mirror, as if
    through smoked glass. I view the world in the same way as others look at the
    Sun in eclipse. Thus I see the Earth in eclipse. I see us moving about
    blindly in eternal Gloom, like May bugs trapped in a box by a cruel child.
    It's easy to harm and injure us, to smash up our intricately assembled,
    bizarre existence.

    I interpret everything as abnormal, terrible and threatening. I see nothing
    but Catastrophes. But as the Fall is the beginning, can we possibly fall
    even lower?

    I have a Theory. It's that an awful thing has happened — our cerebellum has
    not been correctly connected to our brain. This could be the worst mistake
    in our programming. Someone has made us badly. This is why our model ought
    to be replaced. If our cerebellum were connected to our brain, we would
    possess full knowledge of our own anatomy, of what was happening inside our
    bodies. Oh, we'd say to ourselves, the level of potassium in my blood has
    fallen. My third cervical vertebra is feeling tension. My blood pressure is
    low today, I must move about, and yesterday's egg mayonnaise has sent my
    cholesterol level too high, so I must watch what I eat today.


    We have this body of ours, a troublesome piece of luggage, we don't really
    know anything about it and we need all sorts of Tools to find out about its
    most natural processes. Isn't it scandalous that last time a doctor wanted
    to check what was happening in my stomach he made me have a gastroscopy? I
    had to swallow a thick tube, and it took a camera to reveal the inside of my
    stomach to us. The only coarse and primitive Tool gifted us for consolation
    is pain. The angels, if they really do exist, must be splitting their sides
    laughing at us. Fancy being given a body and not knowing anything about it.
    There's no instruction manual.


    Unfortunately, the mistake was made at the very start, as were other errors
    too.
  - That's what I dislike most of all in people — cold irony. It's a very
    cowardly attitude to mock or belittle everything, never be committed to
    anything, not feel tied to anything. Like an impotent man who can't
    experience pleasure himself, but will do all he can to ruin it for others.
    Cold irony is Urizen's basic weapon. The armaments of impotence. At the same
    time the ironists always have a world outlook that they proclaim
    triumphantly, though if one starts badgering and questioning them about the
    details, it turns out to consist of nothing but trivia and banalities.
  - I think we all feel great ambivalence at the sight of our own Horoscope. On
    the one hand we're proud to see that the sky is imprinted on our individual
    life, like a postmark with a date stamped on a letter — this makes it
    distinct, one of a kind. But at the same time it's a form of imprisonment in
    space, like a tattooed prison number. There's no escaping it. I cannot be
    someone other than I am. How awful. We'd prefer to think we're free, able to
    reinvent ourselves whenever we choose. This connection with something as
    great and monumental as the sky makes us feel uncomfortable. We'd rather be
    small, and then our petty little sins would be forgivable.
  - There are various magazines and newspapers that I sometimes buy, but reading
    them usually gives me an unspecified sense of guilt. A feeling that there's
    something I haven't done, something I've forgotten, that I'm not up to the
    demands of the task, that in some essential way I'm lagging behind the rest.
    The newspapers may very well be right. But when one takes a careful look at
    the people passing in the street, one might assume that many others have the
    same problem too, and haven't done what they should with their lives either.

    When I heard Good News' account of her life, I mentally began to formulate
    questions that start with the words 'Why don't you…', followed by a
    description of what — in our view — one should do in this sort of situation.
    My lips were on the point of producing one of these impertinent 'why don't
    yous' when I bit my tongue.


    That's just what the colour magazines do — just for a moment I'd wanted to
    be like them: they tell us what we've failed to do, where we've messed up,
    what we've neglected; ultimately they set us on ourselves, filling us with
    self-contempt.


    So I didn't say a word. Other people's life stories are not a topic for
    debate. One should hear them out, and reciprocate in the same coin. So I
    told Good News about my life too, and invited her to my home to meet my
    Little Girls. And that's what happened.

    For several days I missed him very much — his toiletries in the bathroom and
    even the empty tea cups he left all over the house. He called every day.
    Then less often, every other day or so. He sounded as if he were living in
    another dimension, in a spirit world in the north of the country, where the
    trees are thousands of years old, and large Animals move among them at a
    slowed-down pace, outside time. I calmly watched as the image of Boros
    Sznajder, entomologist and taphonomist, faded and evaporated, until all that
    was left of him was a little grey pigtail hanging in mid-air, ridiculous.
    Everything will pass.


    The wise Man knows this from the start, and has no regrets.

    I had my Theory about interjections of this kind: every single Person has
    their own expression which he or she overuses. Or uses incorrectly. These
    words or phrases are the key to their intellect. Mr 'Apparently', Mr
    'Generally', Mrs 'Probably', Mr 'Fucking', Mrs 'Don't You Think?', Mr 'As
    If'. The President was Mr 'In Truth'. Of course there are entire fashions
    for some words, just like the ones that for some crazy reason suddenly make
    everyone start going about in identical shoes or clothes — people just as
    suddenly start using one particular word or phrase. Recently the word
    'generally' was fashionable, but now 'actually' is out in front.
  - I couldn't help thinking that someone who overuses the phrase 'in truth' is
    sure to be a liar.

    My Venus is damaged, or in exile, that's what you say of a Planet that can't
    be found in the sign where it should be. What's more, Pluto is in a negative
    aspect to Venus, and in my case Pluto rules the Ascendant. The result of
    this situation is that I have, as I see it, Lazy Venus syndrome. That's what
    I call this Conformity. In this case we're dealing with a Person whom
    fortune has gifted generously, but who has entirely failed to use their
    potential. Such People are bright and intelligent, but don't apply
    themselves to their studies, and use their intelligence to play card games
    or patience instead. They have beautiful bodies, but they destroy them
    through neglect, poison themselves with harmful substances, and ignore
    doctors and dentists.


    This Venus induces a strange kind of laziness — lifetime opportunities are
    missed, because you overslept, because you didn't feel like going, because
    you were late, because you were neglectful. It's a tendency to be sybaritic,
    to live in a state of mild semi-consciousness, to fritter your life away on
    petty pleasures, to dislike effort and be devoid of any penchant for
    competition.

    Long mornings, unopened letters, things put off for later, abandoned
    projects. A dislike of any authority and a refusal to submit to it, going
    your own way in a taciturn, idle manner. You could say such people are of no
    use at all.
  - But why should we have to be useful and for what reason? Who divided the
    world into useless and useful, and by what right? Does a thistle have no
    right to life, or a Mouse that eats the grain in a warehouse? What about
    Bees and Drones, weeds and roses? Whose intellect can have had the audacity
    to judge who is better, and who worse? A large tree, crooked and full of
    holes, survives for centuries without being cut down, because nothing could
    possibly be made out of it. This example should raise the spirits of people
    like us. Everyone knows the profit to be reaped from the useful, but nobody
    knows the benefit to be gained from the useless.
