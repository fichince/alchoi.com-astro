title: Fifty Sounds

quotes:
  - "In particular, what I'm burning to tell Duo is the following: Did you know?
    When you immerse yourself in a very different language as a total beginner,
    not only do you not have goals! You also have no system within which to
    conceptualize what those objectives could be - discounting, that is,
    overarching goals like 'learning to read; or 'becoming fluent', which
    themselves start to seem less and less meaningful the more you poke around
    beneath their smooth surfaces!"
  - "Immersion in a foreign language is a bombardment of sounds, until you
    decide that you are going to actually do this thing and learn, and then it
    becomes a bombardment of imperatives: learn this, learn this, learn this.
    _Just start from the basics_, sings a voice in your head as you are tossed
    around in the waves of incomprehensibility. Yet as you continue to live in a
    language you don't know, it becomes increasingly obvious to you how much
    this category of 'basics' could theoretically encompass. Greetings and
    everyday interactions are of course basic, and there is always something
    embarrassing about not knowing basic forms of verbs. Everyone knows numbers
    are incredibly basic, as are colours, clothes, the subjects you study at
    school, animals, anything to do with weather, and adjectives for describing
    people. In fact, we could go ahead and say that every object is also basic,
    and there is something particularly alarming when you don't know how to say
    the first words you would have learned in your language(s) as a child:
    teddy, buggy, shoelace. And then there is the most fundamental-seeming
    vocabulary of all: abstract nouns, like justice, friendship, pleasure, evil,
    and vanity."

    I could attempt to describe why it now feels to me that this sort of
    onomatopoeic language is where the beating heart of Japanese lies. Why, from
    a certain point in time, I ditched my previous ambition to master the
    bewilderingly complex web of honorifics that even native speakers routinely
    get wrong, and which always seemed to distinguish hardcore Japanophiles from
    those whom Japanese society merely humoured, and set my sights instead on
    being able to use mimetic language properly, naturally. Why, to the extent
    that I still have a linguistic ambition, it is to speak the kind of Japanese
    which takes mimetics as its beacon: a Japanese of gesturing and
    storytelling, of searing description, of embodied reality.

    Which is apposite here, because giro' is a sound very much concerned with
    drama. Giro' is a sound of utter attention on the part of the giro'ter, so
    you can almost hear the heart of the giro'tee skipping a mini-beat. A google
    image search for giro yields an array of animals - dogs, cats, bears, owls -
    glaring; this is the sound of not softening the ferocity of one's look for
    the sake of social nicety. Giro' is about letting your eyes fulfil their
    natural, most aquiline potential. It is about using the assets biology and
    society have granted you to make immodest demands of people.
  - "Saturated, so that even when I receded from it, it was there, ringing in my
    ears like nothing had ever done before: min-min min-min. It feels true to
    say that before I properly spoke or understood Japanese, certainly before I
    was properly fixated by it, it assumed the role of constant internal
    soundtrack. My body was alive with the sounds it had collected up throughout
    the day. When I shut my eyes in bed at night I was souped in them, sounds
    that hovered between known and unknown, as if comprehensibility were not in
    fact the currency in which my brain dealt any more, and what was being
    processed was rather the rhythms. And then snatches of it found their way
    into my dreams, hovering there tersely, like life-rafts above the flow of
    images."
  - "I was aware at the time that speaking of freedom in the context of foreign
    escape is a sticky notion, particularly as a white person from a dominant
    culture with a colonialist legacy, and these days I'm even more aware of it.
    It's all too easy to conceptualize the rural paradise you move into as a
    blank canvas for your personal growth, and ignore the existing community; to
    feel yourself free from the tug of social conscience as you trample across
    the needs of others, flout social mores, and cause those around you
    discomfort and labour that you are perfectly unaware of. I tried my best not
    to act in those ways; at times I succeeded, and at others I failed. But
    whatever my intentions, the intense feeling of liberation I began to feel
    was undeniable, and the liberation was mostly from judgement. No longer
    surrounded by pronouncements that I understood, I let the critic in my head
    float away and suddenly I found I could do and say things simply because I
    wanted to. More, as if the obligations clouding my vision washed away, I was
    far clearer on what the things I wanted to do actually were. It was as if
    what had been watching me all the time was my language; I had clung to it as
    the thing that shaped me, but now I was finding that a looser relationship
    with the language, perhaps having a looser shape altogether, was profoundly
    healing. "
  - You are on holiday from the disingenuity of language. You cannot express
    yourself except in the most basic terms, but through that infantile mode of
    expression you glimpse what could have been. It seems to you that you can
    express yourself, plainly, with terrible grammar, and a kind of deep
    profundity, for ever and ever. You have become Yoda, and you embrace the
    transition. Your very incompetence, it seems, has liberated you.
  - "What was perhaps, in the final analysis, the most difficult to deal with
    was that the English-inspired elements of Japanese were not a temporary,
    makeshift insertion, but a legitimate, rule-bound part of the language.
    Embarrassingly, this fact took a while to fully sink in, and in my first few
    weeks I sustained the belief that if, while speaking Japanese, I said
    English words in my normal accent I would be understood, and would in some
    sense be 'righter', because those were the 'real' pronunciations.
    Eventually, of course, I reached the realization that gairaigo were a bona
    fide part of the Japanese language, and were spoken with authority as such;
    if I wanted to communicate properly in Japanese, that was how I would have
    to speak. I would have to say howaitobodo instead of whiteboard, and
    shitoberuto for seatbelt, and if I didn't then I'd be wrong. If I wanted to
    talk about a film star, I would have to know how to say their name in the
    correct katakana pronunciation, otherwise I'd be met with incomprehension.
    That was just how things were. "
  - Even in the midst of my fixation with katakana, I sensed there was something
    boringly predictable about dwelling on this aspect of Japanese. Certainly I
    feel it now. I think about all of those people from Anglophone cultures who
    have visited Japan and have regaled me endlessly with examples of the
    nonsense English they've seen splashed across T-shirts, pencil cases and
    signs; similarly, I've conversed with any number of Japanese people whose
    first comment on their adventures abroad, before any reflections on how the
    country or the people were, was about the sushi restaurant where the lantern
    reading irrashaimasse was hanging upside down, or where all the employees
    were Chinese or Korean. Come on, I want to say, what about all the other
    stuff? Surely the ways in which your language or your culinary culture has
    been used or misused is less interesting than almost everything else about
    that nation, and the experience you had there? Whoever was doing it, this
    cultural navel-gazing seemed to me to reveal an inner miserliness, a
    horrible pedantry of the soul.
  - Your language is what is missing in me, that tantalizing body of knowledge
    which I do not have, which keeps me from what it is that I want. Namely,
    you. Namely, intimacy. Namely, the other, and the impossible merging of my
    self with theirs. That which prevents whole, unadulterated attachment is no
    more than language - or so we tell ourselves. Ultimately, it is this lack in
    us upon which we fixate. 'Who is the real subject of most love poems? Not
    the beloved. It is that hole.'
  - \[T\]o fall in love with someone in another culture is like finding a
    language parent. It is to reproduce something like the relationship that
    most people have in early childhood with their parents, not just in terms of
    the time spent with the person or people who first taught us language, but
    the intensity, the physicality, and maybe above everything the need for
    approval that is likely to make the endeavour succeed. I had relied on my
    parents and they had taught me to speak; now I had found someone else upon
    whom I relied, in various senses, albeit to a lesser degree. I had not
    consciously taken up with Y for that reason, and when I talk now about the
    chronology of my Japanese learning I tend to cast this the other way round,
    saying that one of the reasons I kept going was because I happened to fall
    in love with a Japanese man. And yet when I think about how much I hung on
    his words, how much the thought of irritating him bothered me even if I
    pretended otherwise, and how much that encouraged me to ingest not just his
    words but also the cultural obligations surrounding them, I can't help but
    think that maybe I, like goodness-knows-how-many other people, had hit
    unwittingly, almost as if through biological reflex, upon a strategy that
    would see me into something approaching fluency.
  - "The conventional, monoglot sense of what it means to be bilingual,
    trilingual, and beyond does not permit of difficulties in self-rendering,
    let alone existential crises or identity trauma. We prefer to believe
    unthinkingly that what it means to be yourself across different
    cultural-linguistic contexts is clear-cut: you say the same things
    translated across your various languages. That the reality is often hugely
    different is something to which the majority of those who speak another
    language with some fluency will testify: a survey of over a thousand
    bilinguals found that two-thirds attested to feeling 'like a different
    person' when speaking different languages. To imagine a language means to
    imagine a life-form; to assume that you would be the same person in
    different languages, when not only the norms and rules but most likely also
    your social status and domains of experience and proficiencies within those
    languages are likely to be at least slightly if not fundamentally different,
    seems, when examined, plainly bizarre."

    The subject at hand right now is America, as it often is. I don't have an
    American bone in my body, but I sometimes suspect that that fact has gone
    unnoticed in these discussions, at least by the family patriarch.
    Ultimately, there is one name for Western nations, and it is America. This
    is not unintelligible to me as a perception, and nor is the antagonism shown
    towards this arch-nation. I also know that after the events of the Second
    World War and the Occupation and its aftermath, the emotional stakes run
    particularly high between Japan and the States. Besides this understanding,
    though, it strikes me that there's something faintly paradoxical at work
    here: that the very qualities which supposedly form the bone of contention
    with the States - its size, power, and supposed crassness - are in fact
    ratified by singling it out as uniquely visible, as if only such places
    deserve attention. It puts me in mind of a time back in my first year of
    junior school, when the playground was ruled by a pair of identical twins.
    At some point, the twins had an argument, and in no time at all, the
    entirety of the year was split into two factions, with everyone forced to
    pick sides. I remember how bizarre it seemed to me, even as a four year-old,
    that such a dynamic had evolved between two people who lived in the same
    house, and whom none of the teachers could tell apart - and although the
    situation with Japan and America was clearly different in almost every way,
    there was some of the enmeshed quality which felt of a piece.

    In fact, as time has gone on, I've come to see the phenomenon of the
    'endearingly mystifying translation' as posing more problems than simply
    that of bringing us no closer to a real understanding - I think it also
    plays into a wider pattern of exoticizing and Orientalizing that goes on
    constantly. If our reaction on encountering a dubious translation was to
    accept that the information provided was insuflicient for our purposes, and
    perhaps to ask if there was anything we could do to bring us closer to
    understanding, then all would be well; yet my sense is that there's a
    tendency on discovering an opaque phrase to leap to the assumption that we
    won't ever get there, because the concept in question is on some level
    beyond our understanding - too hazy, strange, mystical. In other words, it's
    not really about the translation, but rather about some quality in the
    source language, source culture. It is, after all, very alien.
  - "One way to describe a state of being careless, of not paying enough
    attention, is uka-uka, which has the same stem as the verb uku: to float, to
    be happy, for your heart to be sunny. Uku also means to stick out, to stand
    out, to be different. It is hard not to see this tangle of meanings as
    brutally indicative: the price you pay for being carefree is to be a social
    outcast. Or conversely, the price that you pay for assimilating is to have
    your consciousness occupied by other people's feelings. I try to steer clear
    of clichés about Japan as I feel there are too many of them around as it is,
    but there is a handful of things people say that are, I believe, actually
    and importantly true, and one of them is this: a key part of being in Japan
    is that gradually, without realizing, _the state of being unlike others_
    comes to seem more and more repellent to you on a subcutaneous level. That
    this happens even if consciously you totally reject this principle, and even
    if on a purely physical level you have no hope of doing anything but
    standing out. Without realizing, you learn to recoil from it."
  - And how real was he to me? In a way, that is the exact question I've come
    here to try and answer. Excessively, seems like a tenable response. It
    didn't take a perceptive genius to see that I'd made a legend of him, a
    one-man nation. I'd fashioned him into a Japan that was mine, and that
    wanted me just as I wanted it. In a sense, that didn't seem like the worst
    of crimes; it was largely that instinct which I had to thank for my progress
    in Japanese, and if what I had done had hurt anybody, it was mostly myself.
    Besides, wasn't that just what you did when you were young and you fell in
    love in a foreign country - you conflated person, language and land, and
    threw yourself at them immoderately? With time, maturity and healing, that
    bond eventually dissolved and was replaced by a more holistic form of social
    integration, and you moved on.
  - "It's strange, really, that such groundedness can exist here, in what seems
    objectively like an implausible place to find certainty: this in-between
    place which is translation, this space where you hover spectral between one
    language and another, where ideas routinely swim, and give way underfoot,
    and where there aren't any right answers. It's not the sort of place that
    you're supposed to draw security from, or which is supposed to make you
    happy or prosperous. As the parable tells us, success is reserved for the
    man who builds his house on the rock. Nowadays I think that maybe I've known
    always somewhere deep down that I couldn't live for long on any rock. What
    took me longer to figure out was that living on the sand didn't have to be
    just a running away or an experience of permanent overwhelm. That the
    topsy-turvy place between languages and cultures, which has been a site of
    humility and triangulation and self-knowledge, of absurdity and inanity and
    the best sort of creative fertility, can also offer, paradoxically, a kind
    of safety. It comes to me that I have built a kind of dwelling here, where I
    can google gorilla noises all day long, and not worry too much about my
    productivity; a big, small, crazy dwelling, in which I don't just work but
    also live."
