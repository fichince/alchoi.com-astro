title: I Didn't Do the Thing Today
author: Madeleine Dore
quotes:
  - "Perhaps we don’t want to be more productive in our days, but more
    fecund—that is, more capable of producing new growth, but not always in
    producing mode. Seen in this light, our days are like fertile gardens: a
    place to plant, to sow, to weed, to prune, to pick, to compost, depending on
    the season"
