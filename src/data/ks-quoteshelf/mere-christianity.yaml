quotes:
  - Men have differed as regards what people you ought to be unselfish
    to—whether it was only your own family, or your fellow countrymen, or every
    one. But they have always agreed that you ought not to put yourself first.
    Selfishness has never been admired.
  - These, then, are the two points I wanted to make. First, that human beings,
    all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a
    certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in
    fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These
    two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the
    universe we live in.
  - In the case of stones and trees and things of that sort, what we call the
    Laws of Nature may not be anything except a way of speaking. When you say
    that nature is governed by certain laws, this may only mean that nature
    does, in fact, behave in a certain way. The so-called laws may not be
    anything real—anything above and beyond the actual facts which we observe.
    But in the case of Man, we saw that this will not do. The Law of Human
    Nature, or of Right and Wrong, must be something above and beyond the actual
    facts of human behaviour. In this case, besides the actual facts, you have
    something else—a real law which we did not invent and which we know we ought
    to obey.
  - Supposing science ever became complete so that it knew every single thing in
    the whole universe. Is it not plain that the questions, 'Why is there a
    universe?' ‘Why does it go on as it does?' ‘Has it any meaning?' would
    remain just as they were?
  - "If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that
    it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and
    therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. *Dark*
    would be a word without meaning."
  - My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust.
    But how had I got this idea of *just* and *unjust*? A man does not call a
    line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I
    comparing this universe with when I called it unjust?
