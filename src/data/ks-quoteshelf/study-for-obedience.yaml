title: Study for Obedience
author: Sarah Bernstein
quotes:
  - Where to begin. I can it is true shed light on my actions only, and even
    then it is a weak and intermittent one. I was the youngest child, the
    youngest of many—more than I care to remember—whom I tended from my earliest
    infancy, before, indeed, I had the power of speech myself and although my
    motor skills were by then scarcely developed, these, my many siblings, were
    put in my charge.
  - Nothing could have induced me to take on a leadership role of any kind, I
    was a faithful and perennial servant, and yet, and no one could have found
    the situation more impossible than I did, it seemed to me that my obedience
    had itself taken on a kind of mysterious power. And if I had been granted
    this power, by some grace, against my wishes, must I not then make use of it
    in some way?
  - "It was a familiar feeling: wherever I had been in my life I was always an
    incomer, an offlander, sometimes a usurper, more rarely a conniver, it was
    something in my blood that made me feel this way and likewise something in
    my blood that made others feel this too, that I was strange somehow, not to
    be trusted."
  - When I exited the automatic doors of the airport, the navigation of which
    had taken me some time since the sensors did not at first register my
    movement, however exaggerated, so I had to wait until another recently
    deplaned passenger  passed through the doors himself to exit, my brother's
    car was already idling at the kerb.
  - The match had been doomed from the start, my brother said as he drove
    through the rain, they had shared too much about themselves, knew too much
    about one another for mutual respect to be possible. What's more, he went
    on, at various times, in alternating turns, they had committed the most
    grievous sins against one another, culminating finally in each speaking
    aloud the terrible truth of the other's personality, truths they had long
    known about themselves and about one another, but about which they had come
    to a tacit agreement never to mention, never to discuss, never to give away
    the slightest hint that such knowledge existed. The wife, knowing the
    essential flaw in the husband's heart, must never speak of it; likewise, the
    awful and indisputable  fact of the wife's character, this too must never be
    spoken by the husband. No, my brother said, not ever. Such was the basis of
    the marital relation.
  - "I had learned over the course of my life that there was something
    unpleasant about this opaque kind of inwardness: at any rate the people
    among whom I was reared demanded legibility - if there was one thing they
    could not stand it was the obscure, they were not a people much interested
    in the pursuit of meaning. They liked constancy. Another way of putting this
    is that they had the soul of the lake, not of the river, and not of the
    sea."
  - He took me under his wing. I became his pupil and his retainer and he made
    me understand the necessity of temperance and silence. I had made an
    essential error when organising my consciousness early on in life, my
    brother explained, and this was by entertaining the idea that it was
    reasonable for me to form my own judgements about the world, about the
    people in it. It was not an uncommon error, my brother went on, but it was a
    conviction particularly unwarranted and also deep-seated in my case. It
    would not be easy to remedy, no, it would be my life's work to reorient all
    my desires in the service of another, that was the most I should expect to
    achieve.
  - And so as I tramped daily through the woods, feeling for once in the world,
    I told myself over and over that I must remember this moment, here, now, a
    moment which could not last and would inevitably be followed by an
    unhappiness that would be commensurate with if not exceeding it in strength,
    and that I must therefore carry it with me, the knowledge that once, for a
    time, for a series of hours, even stretches of days, I had seen what
    happiness might look like, that would have to be enough.
  - Lives layered upon lives, the concentric logic of the world and its
    continual co-optations. I felt a motiveless sorrow.
