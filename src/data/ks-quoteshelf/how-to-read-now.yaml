title: How to Read Now
author: Elaine Castillo
quotes:
  - "There is only so much space I can make for this controversy, both in these
    pages and in my life; controversies like this go beyond racial
    microaggressions—they've become predictable and occasionally lucrative
    trauma engines, and continually asking writers of color to produce a comment
    from the hot-take jukebox on the latest fuckup perpetrated by a dementedly
    racist and tone-deaf publishing industry is asking those writers to wipe a
    shit they did not take. What I'm much more curious about is what these
    fuckups reveal about readership: who we expect our readers to be, what we
    expect our readers to do, and how this might change."
  - "When white readers claim to be made uncomfortable—as many I heard from
    claimed—by the presence of something like untranslated words in fiction,
    what they're really saying is: *I have always been the expected reader*. A
    reader like this is used to the practice of reading being one that may
    performatively challenge them, much the way a safari guides a tourist
    through the \"wilderness\"—but ultimately always prioritizes their comfort
    and understanding."
  - "That art should not serve to make us comfortable is such a basic argument
    I'm loathe to even repeat it. Yet the arguments about the comforts or
    disruptions of art cannot be held in good faith if we don't address the fact
    that a white supremacist reading culture means we are conditioned to accept
    that some of our work is in fact routinely expected to comfort; that the
    work of writers of color must often in some way console, educate, provide
    new definitions, great epiphanies, and, most of all—that buzzword of both
    the commercial marketplace and political theater—be relevant. Whereas the
    work of white writers must be free to: offend, transgress, be exempt, be
    beyond politics, beyond identity—to delight, in other words, in the myriad
    fruits of its political immunity. And their readers must, in turn, always
    extend empathy toward that lucrative and culturally rewarded immunity—which
    is, after all, great art."
  - "The logic of empathy says \"I feel your pain\"—but the logic of inheritance
    knows this transaction has always been corrupt at its core. The story I'm
    telling is not just something for you to feel sympathy for, rage against, be
    educated by: *it's a story about you, too*. This work has left a will, and
    we are all of us named in it: the inheritances therein belong to every
    reader, every writer, every citizen. So, too, the world we get to make from
    it."
  - The problem is, if we need fiction to teach us empathy, we don't really have
    empathy, because empathy is not a one-stop destination; it's a practice,
    ongoing, which requires work from us in our daily lives, for our daily
    lives—not just when we're confronted with the visibly and legibly Other. Not
    just when a particularly gifted author has managed to make a community's
    story come alive for the reader who's come for a quick zoo visit, always
    remaining on her side of the cage.
  - "White supremacy is a comprehensive cultural education whose primary
    function is to prevent people from reading—engaging with, understanding—the
    lives of people outside its scope. This is even more apparent in the kind of
    reading most enthusiastically trafficked by the white liberal literary
    community that has such an outsize influence, intellectually and
    economically, on the publishing industry today. The unfortunate influence of
    this style of reading has dictated that we go to writers of color for the
    gooey heart-porn of the ethnographic: to learn about forgotten history,
    harrowing tragedy, community-destroying political upheaval, genocide,
    trauma; that we expect those writers to provide those intellectual
    commodities the way their ancestors once provided spices, minerals, precious
    stones, and unprecious bodies."
  - I've very often seen successful people of color framing their experiences of
    being the only person of color in their classrooms as narratives about
    struggle, rather than *also* being narratives about class and power; I
    emphasize *often*, because it seems to me that in fact many successful
    people of color in our mainstream media happen to be precisely the sort of
    people who grew up the only person of color in white towns. It is precisely
    *because* they grew up adjacent to whiteness and its social and economic
    privilege, precisely *because* they were well versed at an early age on how
    to adapt to and accommodate whiteness that they could thus use those skills
    as professional adults, living under white supremacy.
  - But the idea that fiction builds empathy is one of incomplete politics, left
    hanging by probably good intentions. The concept of instrumentalizing
    fiction or art as a kind of ethical protein shake, such that reading more
    and more diversely will somehow build the muscles in us that will help us
    see other people as human, makes a kind of superficial sense—and produces a
    superficial effect. The problem with this type of reading is that in its
    practical application, usually readers are encouraged—by well-meaning
    teachers and lazy publishing copy—to read writers of a demographic minority
    in order to *learn* things; which is to say, as a supplement for their
    empathy muscles, a metabolic exchange that turns writers of color into
    little more than ethnographers—personal trainers, to continue the metaphor.
    The result is that we largely end up going to writers of color to learn the
    specific—and go to white writers to feel the universal.
