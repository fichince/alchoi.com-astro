quotes:
  - So, Greta had taken another stab at therapy. After hearing her whole story,
    which had taken ten weeks to tell, the shrink diagnosed her with emotional
    detachment disorder, which seemed like a stretch to Greta, who preferred to
    think of it as "poise" on a bad day, "grace" on a good one, and, when she
    was feeling full of herself, "serenity."
  - She loathed official documents of any kind, which was why she hadn’t filed a
    tax return in six years and didn't have health insurance. Her own birth
    certificate made her sick to her stomach. She also hesitated to sign
    anything, even credit card slips, because she’d never liked her signature.
    She’d tried changing it over the years, but it was like trying to change her
    voice. On the other hand, Hudson was overflowing with people who’d
    successfully reinvented themselves. _I was a corporate lawyer in the city
    for years, and then I moved to Hudson and became a flower farmer/doll
    maker/antiques dealer/chef/arborist/alcoholic, and I never looked back._ "I
    moved to Hudson to reinvent my handwriting," she imagined telling someone
    over drinks. "It's been an incredible journey."
  - She told him about her last boyfriend. He’d had money, a new experience for
    Greta, but zero upper-body strength. He could barely hold himself on top of
    her, and when he did, she felt like she was being made love to by a large,
    trembling finger. They were together two years.
  - She’d heard plenty of extreme stories, but shed never known anyone who’d
    taken such a beating, not even a man, without luxuriating in self-pity. Big
    Swiss didn't possess the impulse to please, to match anyone's needs or
    desires. Her only need, seemingly, was to satisfy her own curiosity. That's
    what drove her into the house and up the stairs. Granted, curiosity killed
    the cat, or, in this case, broke its jaw in two places. Of course, no one
    should get their face pummeled for climbing the wrong stairs or rejecting
    the wrong person, but, given the ridiculous number of red flags—the
    kidnapping, the prison time, the dumpy house, the super-sad dog—Big Swiss
    had not only courted disaster, she’d practically bought it a boutonnière.
  - Greta considered her own behavior around red flags. Her habit was not to
    ignore them so much as to ingest them, a somewhat laborious mental
    production that involved placing them in a stockpot with butter, herbs, and
    mirepoix; cooking over low heat without browning; adding red meat,
    additional red flags, a jug of red wine; and voilà, four hours at a lazy
    simmer later, an extremely rich red-flag stew that she forked into her mouth
    every day like a fucking moron, sometimes for years on end.
  - Big Swiss kissed Greta’s cheek. Then she kissed Greta’s other cheek. Then
    the first cheek again. A Swiss goodbye, Greta assumed, except it happened in
    slow motion. Greta leaned forward and kissed Big Swiss's barely parted lips.
    Big Swiss smiled. Kissing Big Swiss's teeth was jarring and humiliating,
    like kissing a bathroom sink. But maybe that was too unkind. It was like
    kissing a baptismal font full of holy water.

    "It's incredible to me that you're still getting mileage out of your
    mother's suicide. You're still using it as currency, even though it has
    nothing to do with what you did. In fact, it's kind of psychotic that you're
    spending that currency on this moment. When will it run out?"


    Never, Greta thought. I've been living on it all my life.


    Big Swiss went on. "If everything can be explained by your trauma, then
    nothing is really your fault, right? You always have this convenient out.
    Your mother killed herself, and so that gives you permission to do whatever
    you want? To eavesdrop on my therapy sessions? To fuck me?"
