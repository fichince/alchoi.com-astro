author: Thomas Pynchon
quotes:
  - The young statistician is devoted to number and to method, not table-rapping
    or wishful thinking. But in the domain of zero to one, not-something to
    something, Pointsman can only possess the zero and the one. He cannot, like
    Mexico, survive anyplace in between.
  - Solitude, even among the meshes of this war, can when it wishes so take him
    by the blind gut and touch, as now, possessively.

    “Hhahh," Pirate in a voiceless roar watching his breath slip away over the
    parapets, "hhaahhh!" Rooftops dance in the morning. His giant bananas
    cluster, radiant yellow, humid green. His companions below dream drooling of
    a Banana Breakfast. This well-scrubbed day ought to be no worse than any—


    Will it? Far to the east, down in the pink sky, something has just sparked,
    very brightly. A new star, nothing less noticeable. He leans on the parapet
    to watch. The brilliant point has already become a short vertical white
    line. It must be somewhere out over the North Sea at least that far…
    icefields below and a cold smear of sun…
  - He has become obsessed with the idea of a rocket with his name written on
    it—if they're really set on getting him (“They" embracing possibilities far
    far beyond Nazi Germany) that's the surest way, doesn't cost them a thing to
    paint his name on every one, right?
  - Yesterday happened to be a good day. They found a child, alive, a little
    girl, half-suffocated under a Morrison shelter. Waiting for the stretcher,
    Slothrop held her small hand, gone purple with the cold. Dogs barked in the
    street. When she opened her eyes and saw him her first words were, "Any gum,
    chum?" Trapped there for two days, gumless—all he had for her was a Thayer's
    Slippery Elm. He felt like an idiot. Before they took her off she brought
    his hand over to kiss anyway, her mouth and cheek in the flare lamps cold as
    frost, the city around them at once a big desolate icebox, stale-smelling
    and no surprises inside ever again. At which point she smiled, very faintly,
    and he knew that's what he'd been waiting for, wow, a Shirley Temple smile,
    as if this exactly canceled all they'd found her down in the middle of.
  - He's wasted gallons of paint thinner striking his faithful Zippo, its
    charred wick, virility giving way to thrift, rationed down to a little stub,
    the blue flame sparking about the edges in the dark, the many kinds of dark,
    just to see what's happening with her face. Each new flame, a new face.
  - "Once Roger and Jessica might have stopped. But they're both alumni of the
    Battle of Britain, both have been drafted into the early black mornings and
    the crying for mercy, the dumb inertia of cobbles and beams, the profound
    shortage of mercy in those days… By the time one has pulled one's nth victim
    or part of a victim free of one's nth pile of rubble, he told her once,
    angry, weary, it has ceased to be that personal… the value of n may be
    different for each of us, but I'm sorry: sooner or later…"
