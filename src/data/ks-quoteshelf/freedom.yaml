title: Freedom
author: Jonathan Franzen
quotes:
  - She was already fully the thing that was just starting to happen to the rest
    of the street.
  - >
    "It's a wonder," Seth Paulsen remarked to Merrie afterward, "that the two of
    them are even still together."


    Merrie shook her head. "I don't think they've figured out yet how to live."

    Patty grew up in Westchester County, New York. She was the oldest of four
    children, the other three of whom were more like what her parents had been
    hoping for. She was notably Larger than everybody else, also Less Unusual,
    also measurably Dumber. Not actually dumb but relatively dumber.
  - >
    "Wow, thank you so much for the compliment!" Patty answered brightly, to end
    things. At the time, she believed that it was because she was selflessly
    team-spirited that direct personal compliments made her so uncomfortable.
    The autobiographer now thinks that compliments were like a beverage she was
    unconsciously smart enough to deny herself even one drop of, because her
    thirst for them was infinite.
  - The autobiographer has no doubt that if Patty had been more conscious of
    herself and paying any halfway decent kind of attention to the world around
    her, she wouldn't have been nearly as good at college basketball. Success at
    sports is the province of the almost empty head. Reaching a vantage point
    from which she could have seen Eliza for what she was (i.e., disturbed)
    would have messed with her game. You don't get to be an 88-percent
    free-throw shooter by giving deep thought to every little thing.
  - Patty knew, in her heart, that he was wrong in his impression of her. And
    the mistake she went on to make, the really big life mistake, was to go
    along with Walter's version of her in spite of knowing that it wasn't right.
    He seemed so certain of her goodness that eventually he wore her down.
  - There's a hazardous sadness to the first sounds of someone else's work in
    the morning; it's as if stillness experiences pain in being broken. The
    first minute of the workday reminds you of all the other minutes that a day
    consists of, and it's never a good thing to think of minutes as individuals.
    Only after other minutes have joined the naked, lonely first minute does the
    day become more safely integrated in its dayness.
  - "\\[Patty\\] sounded like a nattering older lady, not the vital force
    \\[Joey\\] still imagined when he allowed himself to think of her. He had to
    squeeze his eyes shut to avert renewed weeping. Everything he'd done with
    regard to her in the last three years had been calculated to foreclose the
    intensely personal sort of talks they'd had when he was younger: to get her
    to _shut up_, to train her to contain herself, to make her stop pestering
    him with her overfull heart and her uncensored self. And now that the
    training was complete and she was obediently trivial with him, he felt
    bereft of her and wanted to undo it."
  - What he'd been dismayed by tonight on the telephone was how completely
    unstupid she had sounded. This, indeed, was the substance of her reproach.
    She didn't seem to be very good at living her life, but it wasn't because
    she was stupid. Almost the opposite somehow. She had a comical-tragical
    sense of herself and seemed, moreover, genuinely apologetic for the way she
    was. And yet it all added up to a reproach of him. As if she were speaking
    some sophisticated but dying aboriginal language which it was up to the
    younger generation (i.e., Joey) to either perpetuate or be responsible for
    the death of. Or as if she were one of his dad's endangered birds, singing
    its obsolete song in the woods in the forlorn hope of some passing kindred
    spirit hearing it. There was her, and then there was the rest of the world,
    and by the very way she chose to speak to him she was reproaching him for
    placing his allegiance with the rest of the world. And who could fault him
    for preferring the world? He had his own life to try to live! The problem
    was that when he was younger, in his weakness, he'd let her see that he did
    understand her language and did recognize her song, and now she couldn't
    seem to help reminding him that those capacities were still inside him,
    should he ever feel like exercising them again.
  - The angry words he'd spoken to his father had felt pre-formed, as if there
    were an aggrieved second self inside him 24/7, ordinarily invisible but
    clearly fully sentient and ready to vent itself, at a moment's notice, in
    the form of sentences independent of his volition. It made him wonder who
    his real self was; and this was very disturbing.
  - "He let the phone slip from his hand and lay crying for a while, silently,
    shaking the cheap bed. He didn't know what to do, he didn't know how to
    live. Each new thing he encountered in life impelled him in a direction that
    fully convinced him of its rightness, but then the next new thing loomed up
    and impelled him in the opposite direction, which also felt right. There was
    no controlling narrative: he seemed to himself a purely reactive pinball in
    a game whose only object was to stay alive for staying alive's sake. To
    throw away his marriage and follow Lalitha had felt irresistible until the
    moment he saw himself, in the person of Jessica's older colleague, as
    another overconsuming white American male who felt entitled to more and more
    and more: saw the romantic imperialism of his falling for someone fresh and
    Asian, having exhausted domestic supplies. Likewise the course he'd charted
    for two and a half years with the Trust, convinced of the soundness of his
    arguments and the rightness of his mission, only to feel, this morning, in
    Charleston, that he'd made nothing but horrible mistakes. And likewise the
    overpopulation initiative: what better way to live could there be than to
    throw himself into the most critical challenge of his time? A challenge that
    then seemed trumped-up and barren when he thought of his Lalitha with her
    tubes tied. How to live?"
  - "\"It's all circling around the same problem of personal liberties,\" Walter
    said. \"People came to this country for either money or freedom. If you
    don't have money, you cling to your freedoms all the more angrily. Even if
    smoking kills you, even if you can't afford to feed your kids, even if your
    kids are getting shot down by maniacs with assault rifles. You may be poor,
    but the one thing nobody can take away from you is the freedom to fuck up
    your life whatever way you want to. That's what Bill Clinton figured
    out—that we can't win elections by running against personal liberties.
    Especially not against guns, actually.\""

    He became another data point in the American experiment of self-government,
    an experiment statistically skewed from the outset, because it wasn't the
    people with sociable genes who fled the crowded Old World for the new
    continent; it was the people who didn't get along well with others.
  - America, for Einar, was the land of unSwedish freedom, the place of
    wide-open spaces where a son could still imagine he was special. But nothing
    disturbs the feeling of specialness like the presence of other human beings
    feeling identically special. Having achieved, through his native
    intelligence and hard labor, a degree of affluence and independence, but not
    nearly enough of either, he became a study in anger and disappointment.
    After his retirement, in the 1950s, he began sending his relatives annual
    Christmas letters in which he lambasted the stupidity of America's
    government, the inequities of its political economy, and the fatuity of its
    religion—drawing, for example, in one particularly caustic Christmas
    greeting, a cunning parallel between the unwed madonna of Bethlehem and the
    "Swedish whore" Ingrid Bergman, the birth of whose own "bastard" had lately
    been celebrated by American media controlled by "corporate interests."
    Though an entrepreneur himself, Einar detested big business. Though he'd
    made a career of government contracts, he hated the government as well. And
    though he loved the open road, the road made him miserable and crazy. He
    bought American sedans with the biggest engines available, so that he could
    do ninety and a hundred on the dead-flat Minnesota state highways, many of
    them built by him, and roar past the stupid people in his way. If an
    oncoming car approached him at night with its high beams on, Einar's
    response was to put his own high beams on and leave them on. If some pinhead
    dared to try to pass him on a two-lane road, he floored the accelerator to
    keep pace and then decelerated to prevent the would-be passer from getting
    back in line, taking special pleasure when there was danger of a collision
    with an oncoming truck. If another driver cut him off or refused him the
    right of way, he pursued the offending car and tried to force it off the
    road, so that he could jump out and shout curses at its driver. (The
    personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality
    also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage.)
