title: Worry-Free Money
author: Shannon Lee Simmons
quotes:
  - If you don't know what you can and cannot actually afford, every purchase
    feels terrifying. Was the $40 takeout a bad financial decision that you
    should beat yourself up for, or was it okay? Will an extra $100 in rent
    really push out your dreams of home ownership for years, or will it make no
    difference at all? How guilty and afraid should you actually be when you
    spend money? This constant sense of vague guilt makes it feel as if there's
    no plan and no strategy to your finances.

    If I gave you $100 with instructions to give me back $40 later that day or
    else you'd be in serious financial trouble, you'd probably happily spend the
    other $60 without a second thought and hand over the remaining $40 with a
    smile. No guilt, no stress, no uncertainty. Now imagine I give you $100 with
    instructions to give *some* of it back to me at a later date or else you'll
    be in serious financial trouble. You don't know how much money you'll have
    to give back or when I'm going to ask for it. All you know is that some
    amount of money will have to be available at a moment's notice when I come
    calling for it.


    If this were the case, you'd probably spend much less than $60, just to be
    careful. Maybe I'll ask for only $20 back and you could have spent $80, but
    you simply won't know. The result would be apprehension every time you spent
    *any* of that money, because you *might* be overspending. I might come back
    demanding $95, making even a $10 purchase risky. Uncertainty breeds guilt,
    fear and constant worry. It's exhausting.

    The true solution to managing your cash flow is to let go of the idea that
    you are in control of your daily spending. You're not. Say it with me now:
    I'm not in control of my daily spending. You need to accept the fact that
    your spending money must be fluid, flexible and able to respond to the
    ever-changing demands of daily life.


    Obviously you shouldn't be spending *all* your money, but you're definitely
    allowed to spend *some*. We aren't on this earth merely to pay our phone
    bills.
  - When it comes to "How to Cut Expenses, Today" or "Five Best Ways to Save
    Money" articles and blog posts, they typically tell you to pay your bills
    and cut, cut, cut your spending where you can. I'm so tired of those
    pack-your-lunch and forgo-the-daily-latte tips. This type of frugality
    implies that you need to train yourself to buy only carefully budgeted and
    well-priced necessities such as groceries, gas and similar supplies.
    Anything beyond that is probably something you don't need, something that
    you simply want. If it's something you just want, as a motivated budgeter
    you should be able to cut back on it easily enough. If you can't reduce your
    wants and purchase only what you need, then you clearly suck at handling
    money. Why can't you control yourself? Are you weak-willed? Geez. It is
    exactly this type of mindset that makes you feel guilty or insecure every
    time you open your wallet.
