author: Claire Dederer
quotes:
  - "If you retreat from the world, and serve only your own needs, you’re bound
    to get lonely, right? The thing is, writers don’t really get lonely. Liking
    being alone—even liking loneliness itself—is part of what makes a writer a
    writer. After I had children, I was an almost full-time mom, working about a
    quarter time at freelance writing. I thought to myself, how lucky that I am
    a writer, so that when I am working I get all this lovely restorative alone
    time. It was years before I realized: Oh. I became a writer so I could be
    alone all the time. It wasn’t a by-product, it was a motivator."

    We’re all wandering around in a mistaken daze of failed telepathy.


    This can benefit the artist (she sells more books); but mostly it benefits
    tech behemoths that monetize these relationships and—in the words of the
    social psychologist and philosopher Shoshana Zuboff—use your information to
    trade on “behavioral futures markets.” In this sense, all of us who
    participate in parasocial relationships are workers creating money for
    somebody else.
  - The way you consume art doesn’t make you a bad person, or a good one. You’ll
    have to find some other way to accomplish that.
  - "But hold up for a minute: who is this “we” that’s always turning up in
    critical writing? We is an escape hatch. We is cheap. We is a way of
    simultaneously sloughing off personal responsibility and taking on the
    mantle of easy authority. It’s the voice of the middlebrow male critic, the
    one who truly believes he knows how everyone else should think. We is
    corrupt. We is make-believe. The real question is this: can I love the art
    but hate the artist? Can you? When I say “we,” I mean I. I mean you"
  - This impulse—to blame the other guy—is in fact a political impulse. I talked
    earlier about the word “we.” “We” can be an escape hatch from
    responsibility. It can be a megaphone. But it can also be a casting out. Us
    against them. The morally correct people against the immoral ones. The
    process of making someone else wrong so that we may be more right.
  - "The feminism I knew of was a feminism that found fault. That
    pointed—j’accuse. As I understood it, there were two ways of being: you
    could be a feminist who called men monsters, or you could ignore the
    problem. I considered myself a feminist, but at the same time I had an
    uneasy feeling that the pointing was not the whole story. A feminism that
    denounced, that punished, was starting to feel like a trap. My feminism,
    which was in essence a liberal ideology, was coming into conflict with my
    increasingly leftist politics, my growing desire to look at a bigger picture
    of where and how material power coalesces"

    When someone says we ought to separate the art from the artist, they’re
    saying: Remove the stain. Let the work be unstained. But that’s not how
    stains work.
    				We watch the glass fall to the floor; we don’t get to decide whether the wine will spread across the carpet
  - The principle of retroactivity means that if you’ve done something
    sufficiently asshole-like, it follows that you were an asshole all along.
  - The problem is, we don’t get to control how much we know about someone’s
    life. It’s something that happens to us. We turn on Seinfeld, and, whether
    we want to or not, we think of Michael Richards’s racist rant. This movement
    toward knowingness began with the birth of mass media, grew in the last
    century, and has flowered in our moment. There is no longer any escaping
    biography. Even within my own lifetime, I’ve seen a massive shift. Biography
    used to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it
    falls on your head all day long.
  - Nostalgia, personal experience—these things become meaningful in terms of
    calculating the badness of the act against the greatness of the work.
    Greatness isn’t something that is simply agreed upon by authority—as we’ve
    seen, that authority too often runs contra to the interests or the
    experiences or simply the aesthetic tastes of too many people. What makes
    great art depends on who we are and what we live through. It depends on our
    feelings.
  - "The contemporary ideal of the genius is a two-headed figure: both master
    and servant."
  - "We think about Wagner and we ask the question: what should we do about sins
    from the past, now that we’re enlightened? But what if we rephrased it: what
    should we do about sins from the past, when we haven’t improved?"
  - Nabokov himself of course would have had contempt for any attempt to guess
    what was in his heart. Even the idea of Nabokov having a heart is a bit hard
    to imagine. This reader wonders if maybe he had novels instead of a heart.
  - "Consuming a piece of art is two biographies meeting: the biography of the
    artist that might disrupt the viewing of the art; the biography of the
    audience member that might shape the viewing of the art. This occurs in
    every case."
  - It’s easy to think of the quality of genius as justifying bad behavior, but
    maybe it works the other way around too. Maybe we have created the idea of
    genius to serve our own attraction to badness. Maybe we ask these artists to
    live out our darkest fantasies—and if we give it the label “genius,” then we
    don’t have to feel guilt for enjoying the spectacle. We can get off on the
    performance of badness, we can consume the biography, and remain in good
    taste. Well, he’s a genius. You can’t blame him. (Or me.)
  - There are many qualities one must possess to be a working writer or artist.
    Talent, brains, tenacity. Wealthy parents are good. You should definitely
    try to have those. But first among equals, when it comes to necessary
    ingredients, is selfishness. A book is made out of small selfishnesses. The
    selfishness of shutting the door against your family. The selfishness of
    ignoring the pram in the hall. The selfishness of forgetting the real world
    to create a new one. The selfishness of stealing stories from real people.
    The selfishness of saving the best of yourself for that blank-faced
    anonymous paramour, the reader. The selfishness that comes from simply
    saying what you have to say.
  - "Every writer-mother I know has asked herself this question. I mean, none of
    them says it out loud. But I can hear them thinking it; it’s almost
    deafening. Does one identity fatally interrupt the other? Is your work
    making you a less-good mom? That’s the question you ask yourself all the
    time. But also: is your motherhood making you a less good writer? That
    question is a little more uncomfortable."
  - What the artist or writer or musician needs desperately is time. And what
    the family needs is time. This conflict is not necessarily solvable.
  - The truth is, art-making and parenthood act very efficiently as
    disincentives to one another, and people who say otherwise are deluded, or
    childless, or men.
  - The novelist John Banville told the Irish Times that he was, not to put too
    fine a point on it, a shitty dad, and what’s more, probably most writers
    are. “[Writing] was very hard…on the people around me, on my children. I
    have not been a good father. I don’t think any writer is. You take so much
    and suck up so much of the oxygen that it’s very hard on one’s loved ones.”

    This kind of thinking is conditional: If I’d been in x place at y time, I
    would’ve done z thing. There’s actually a name for this construction in
    grammar. It’s called the third conditional tense, and is explained thus:
    “The third conditional tense describes something that did not happen, but
    could have happened given the right conditions.”


    Given the right conditions, we would’ve done the right thing.

    “The resentment, the anger, is impersonal. It is the disease of women in our
    time…. The unlucky ones, who do not know it is impersonal, turn it against
    their men.”


    These latter days I feared I might be one of Lessing’s unlucky ones, taking
    it personally over and over, finding in my husband’s inability to overcome
    the privileges of millennia and do the fucking dishes evidence of his lack
    of love and respect for me.

    Condemnation of the canceled celebrity affirms the idea that there is some
    positive celebrity who does not have the stain of the canceled celebrity.
    The bad celebrity, once again, reinforces the idea of the good celebrity, a
    thing that doesn’t exist, because celebrities are not agents of morality,
    they’re reproducible images.


    The fact is that our consumption, or lack thereof, of the work is
    essentially meaningless as an ethical gesture.
  - >-
    We want the asshole to cross the line, to break the rules. We reward that
    rule-breaking, and then we go a step further, and see it as endemic to
    art-making itself. We reward and reward this bad behavior until it becomes
    synonymous with greatness. Not just because the gatekeepers and publishers
    and studio heads have traditionally been men, but also because we ourselves
    yearn for plot and action. We yearn for events!


    And then we are furious when this eventful asshole commits a crime.
  - >-
    When we ask “what do we do with the art of monstrous men?” we are putting
    ourselves into a static role—the role of consumer.


    Passing the problem on to the consumer is how capitalism works. A series of
    decisions is made—decisions that are not primarily concerned with ethics—and
    then the consumer is left to figure out how to respond, how to parse the
    correct and ethical way to behave.
  - "An autobiography of the audience should be subject to the same rules that
    govern all memoir, including the rule that the writer of memoir must be
    *onto* herself. Which is to say that bad memoir happens when an author is a
    little in love with herself—when she can’t see her own faults. The same
    thing could be said of the audience: we think we’re fantastically
    enlightened, but are we really so much better than the people who came
    before us?"
  - Even to this day, I feel my interest in a story waning if a pregnancy
    occurs. And I speak as someone who has loved being a mother—in fact, I even
    liked being pregnant. But as a reader, a pregnancy makes my heart sink.
    Pregnancy is the end of narrative. All the doors shut at once. *Don’t cut
    yourself off from options!* I want to yell at the pregnant characters in
    these books.
