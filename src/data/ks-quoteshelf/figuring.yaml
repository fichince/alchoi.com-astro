quotes:
  - All of it—the rings of Saturn and my father's wedding band, the underbelly
    of the clouds pinked by the rising sun, Einstein's brain bathing in a jar of
    formaldehyde, every grain of sand that made the glass that made the jar and
    each idea Einstein ever had, the shepherdess singing in the Rila mountains
    of my native Bulgaria and each one of her sheep, every hair on Chance's
    velveteen dog ears and Marianne Moore's red braid and the whiskers of
    Montaigne's cat, every translucent fingernail on my friend Amanda's newborn
    son, every stone with which Virginia Woolf filled her coat pockets before
    wading into the River Ouse to drown, every copper atom composing the disc
    that carried arias aboard the first human-made object to enter interstellar
    space and every oak splinter of the floorboards onto which Beethoven
    collapsed in the fit of fury that cost him his hearing, the wetness of every
    tear that has ever been wept over a grave and the yellow of the beak of
    every raven that has ever watched the weepers, every cell in Galileo's
    fleshy finger and every molecule of gas and dust that made the moons of
    Jupiter to which it pointed, the Dipper of freckles constellating the olive
    firmament of a certain forearm I love and every axonal flutter of the
    tenderness with which I love her, all the facts and figments by which we are
    perpetually figuring and reconfiguring reality—it all banged into being 13.8
    billion years ago from a single source, no louder than the opening note of
    Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, no larger than the dot levitating over the small
    _i_, the _I_ lowered from the pedestal of ego.
