  - >-
    Is it true that the literary world is mined with hatred, a battlefield
    rimmed with

    snipers where jealousies and rivalries are always being played out? asked
    the NPR

    interviewer of the distinguished author. Who allowed that it was. There’s a
    lot

    of envy and enmity, the author said. And he tried to explain: It’s like a
    sinking

    raft that too many people are trying to get onto. So any push you can
    deliver makes

    the raft a little higher for you.


    If reading really does increase empathy, as we are constantly being told
    that it does, it appears that writing takes some

    away.
