title: Inside of a Dog
author: Alexandra Horowitz
quotes:
  - "For any anthropomorphism we use to describe our dogs, we can ask two
    questions: One, is there a natural behavior this action might have evolved
    from? And two, what would that anthropomorphic claim amount to if we
    deconstructed it?"
  - What is considered *aggressive* is culturally and generationally relative.
    German shepherds were on the top of the list after World War II; in the
    1990s Rottweilers and Dobermans were scorned; the American Staffordshire
    terrier (also known as the pit bull) is the current bête noire. Their
    classification has more to do with recent events and public perception than
    with their intrinsic nature. Recent research found that of all breeds,
    *dachshunds* were the most aggressive to both their own owners and to
    strangers. Perhaps this is underreported because a snarling dachshund can be
    picked up and stashed away in a tote bag.
  - Not only do dogs not typically hunt to feed themselves—whether encouraged to
    or not—but what hunting technique they have is, it has been noted, "sloppy."
    A wolf makes a calm, steady track toward his prey, without any frivolous
    moves; untrained dogs' hunting walks are herky-jerky, meandering back and
    forth, speeding and slowing. Worse, they may get waylaid by distracting
    sounds or a sudden urge to playfully pursue a falling leaf. Wolves' tracks
    reveal their intent. Dogs have lost this intent; we have replaced it with
    ourselves.
  - "It was our way of interacting together that made her who she was, that
    makes dogs that most people want to live with: interested in our goings and
    comings, attentive to us, not overly intrusive, playful just at the right
    times. She interpreted the world through acting on it, by seeing others act,
    by being shown, and by acting with me on the world—promoted into being a
    good member of the family. And the more time we spent together, the more she
    became who she was, and the more we were intertwined."
  - What specificity of image the name "vomeronasal" conjures up! Evoking the
    displeasure of getting a good sniff of fresh vomit, the "vomer" is actually
    a description of the part of the small bone in the nose where the sensory
    cells sit. Still, the name seems somehow fitting for an animal that is
    notorious for coprophagia (feces eating) and that may lick another dog's
    urine off the ground. Neither act is vomitous for dogs; it's just a way of
    getting even more information about other dogs or animals in the area. The
    vomeronasal organ, first discovered in reptiles, is a specialized sac above
    the mouth or in the nose covered with more receptor sites for molecules.
  - In the annals of animal urine marking, dogs are not the most impressive
    players. Hippopotami wave their tails as they spray urine, better to scatter
    it, sprinkler-like, in all directions. There are rhinoceroses who follow
    their high-powered urination onto bushes with destruction of the same bushes
    with horn and hoof—to ensure, presumably, that their urine is spread far and
    wide. Pity the owner whose dog is the first to discover the
    spreading-efficiency of high-powered, whirling-sprinkler urination.
  - "Those who study sheepdogs observe, for instance, that dogs will growl at
    sheep. Growling is a dog communication: the dog is treating the sheep more
    like a dog than like a possible meal. These dogs' only fault is to
    overgeneralize: not only are they clear on their own identity, in some
    sense—they also think that everyone else is a dog, too. One could call this
    foible very human: they talk to sheep as though they were dogs, just as we
    talk to dogs as though they were humans."
  - "And despite their marvelous range and extent of communication, it is the
    very fact that they do not use language that makes me especially treasure
    dogs. Their silence can be one of their most endearing traits. Not muteness:
    absence of linguistic noise. There is no awkwardness in a shared silent
    moment with a dog: a gaze from the dog on the other side of the room; lying
    sleepily alongside each other. It is when language stops that we connect
    most fully."
  - "The dog laugh is a breathy exhalation that  sounds like an excited burst of
    panting. We could call it *social panting*: it is a pant only heard when
    dogs are playing or trying to get someone to play with them. Dogs don't seem
    to laugh to themselves, off sitting in the corner of the room, recollecting
    how that tawny dog in the park outsmarted her human this morning. Instead,
    dogs laugh when interacting socially. If you have played with your dog, you
    have probably heard it. In fact, doing your own social panting toward a dog
    is one of the most effective ways to elicit play."
  - Dogs are much better at learning about things that are important to us in
    our visual world than we seem to be in understanding theirs. I still can't
    tell you why Pump became excited at the mere sight of a husky-shaped dog
    appearing around the corner. But after a dozen years I began to notice that
    she did. She, on the other hand, was quicker to recognize the importance I
    placed on certain objects—the distinction between the frayed sofa and my
    favored armchair with respect to her chance of sitting on it; the slippers
    whose fetching made me laugh versus the running shoes whose delivery made me
    scold.
