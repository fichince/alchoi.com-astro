quotes:
  - Intimacy can be an unbearable burden for those who, first experiencing it
    after a lifetime of proud self-sufficiency, suddenly realize it makes their
    world complete. Finding bliss becomes one with the fear of losing it. They
    doubt their right to hold someone else accountable for their happiness; they
    worry that their loved one may find their reverence tedious; they fear their
    yearning may have distorted their features in ways they cannot see. Thus, as
    the weight of all these questions and concerns bends them inward, their
    newfound joy in companionship turns into a deeper expression of the solitude
    they thought they had left behind.
  - Most of us prefer to believe we are the active subjects of our victories but
    only the passive objects of our defeats. We triumph, but it is not really we
    who fail—we are ruined by forces beyond our control.

    It is hard work to give money away. It requires a great deal of planning and
    strategizing. If not managed properly, philanthropy can both harm the giver
    and spoil the receiver. Expand. Generosity is the mother of ingratitude.


    As Mildred's charitable endeavors grew I saw the need to organize them after
    a rational fashion. This is why in 1926 I created the Mildred Bevel
    Charitable Fund. Not only did I endow it amply, but I also managed the funds
    so that the giving followed a systematic approach and did not deplete the
    capital. General financial architecture of MBCF. Why it was so innovative.
    Milestones.
