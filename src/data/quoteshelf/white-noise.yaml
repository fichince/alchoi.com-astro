quotes:
- Babette and I do our talking in the kitchen. The kitchen and the bedroom are the
  major chambers around here, the power haunts, the sources. She and I are alike in
  this, that we regard the rest of the house as storage space for furniture, toys,
  all the unused objects of earlier marriages and different sets of children, the
  gifts of lost in-laws, the hand-me-downs and rummages. Things, boxes. Why do these
  possessions carry such sorrowful weight? There is a darkness attached to them, a
  foreboding. They make me wary not of personal failure and defeat but of something
  more general, something large in scope and content.

  “You're saying maybe you're taking something that has the side effect of impairing memory.”

  “Either I'm taking something and I don't remember or I'm not taking something and I don't remember. My life is either/or. Either I chew regular gum or I chew sugarless gum. Either I chew gum or I smoke. Either I smoke or I gain weight. Either I gain weight or I run up the stadium steps.”

  “Sounds like a boring life.”

  "I hope it lasts forever," she said.
- We are quartered in Centenary Hall, a dark brick structure we share with the popular
  culture department, known officially as American environments. A curious group.
  The teaching staff is composed almost solely of New York émigrés, smart, thuggish,
  movie-mad, trivia-crazed. They are here to decipher the natural language of the
  culture, to make a formal method of the shiny pleasures they'd known in their Europe-shadowed
  childhoods—an Aristotelianism of bubble gum wrappers and detergent jingles.
- '"What was the barn like before it was photographed?" he said. "What did it look
  like, how was it different from other barns, how was it similar to other barns?
  We can''t answer these questions because we''ve read the signs, seen the people
  snapping the pictures. We can''t get outside the aura. We''re part of the aura.
  We''re here, we''re now.”'
- '"I can''t help being happy in a town called Blacksmith," he said. "I''m here to
  avoid situations. Cities are full of situations, sexually cunning people. There
  are parts of my body I no longer encourage women to handle freely. I was in a situation
  with a woman in Detroit. She needed my semen in a divorce suit. The irony is that
  I love women. I fall apart at the sight of long legs, striding, briskly, as a breeze
  carries up from the river, on a weekday, in the play of morning light. The second
  irony is that it''s not the bodies of women that I ultimately crave but their minds.
  The mind of a woman. The delicate chambering and massive unidirectional flow, like
  a physics experiment. What fun it is to talk to an intelligent woman wearing stockings
  as she crosses her legs. That little staticky sound of rustling nylon can make me
  happy on several levels. The third and related irony is that it''s the most complex
  and neurotic and difficult women that I am invariably drawn to. I like simple men
  and complicated women.”'
- Would they regard a parent's death as just another form of divorce?
- '"The flow is constant," Alfonse said. "Words, pictures, numbers, facts, graphics,
  statistics, specks, waves, particles, motes. Only a catastrophe gets our attention.
  We want them, we need them, we depend on them. As long as they happen somewhere
  else. This is where California comes in. Mud slides, brush fires, coastal erosion,
  earthquakes, mass killings, et cetera. We can relax and enjoy these disasters because
  in our hearts we feel that California deserves whatever it gets. Californians invented
  the concept of life-style. This alone warrants their doom."'
- Doctors' offices depress me even more than hospitals do because of their air of
  negative expectancy and because of the occasional patient who leaves with good news,
  shaking the doctor's antiseptic hand and laughing loudly, laughing at everything
  the doctor says, booming with laughter, with crude power, making a point of ignoring
  the other patients as he walks past the waiting room still laughing provocatively—he
  is already clear of them, no longer associated with their weekly gloom, their anxious
  inferior dying. I would rather visit an emergency ward, some urban well of trembling,
  where people come in gut-shot, slashed, sleepy-eyed with opium compounds, broken
  needles in their arms. These things have nothing to do with my own eventual death,
  nonviolent, small-town, thoughtful.
- The family is the cradle of the world's misinformation. There must be something
  in family life that generates factual error. Overcloseness, the noise and heat of
  being. Perhaps something even deeper, like the need to survive. Murray says we are
  fragıle creatures surrounded by a world of hostile facts. Facts threaten our happiness
  and security. The deeper we delve into the nature of things, the looser our structure
  may seem to become. The family process works toward sealing off the world. Small
  errors grow heads, fictions proliferate. I tell Murray that ignorance and confusion
  can’t possibly be the driving forces behind family solidarity. What an idea, what
  a subversion. He asks me why the strongest family units exist in the least developed
  societies. Not to know is a weapon of survival, he says. Magic and superstition
  become entrenched as the powerful orthodoxy of the clan. The family is strongest
  where objective reality is most likely to be misinterpreted. What a heartless theory,
  I say. But Murray insists it's true.
- She claims my death would leave a bigger hole in her life than her death would leave
  in mine. This is the level of our discourse. The relative size of holes, abysses
  and gaps. We have serious arguments on this level. She says if her death is capable
  of leaving a large hole in my life, my death would leave an abyss in hers, a great
  yawning gulf. I counter with a profound depth or void. And so it goes into the night.
  These arguments never seem foolish at the time. Such is the dignifying power of
  our subject.
- Our fear was accompanied by a sense of awe that bordered on the religious. It is
  surely possible to be awed by the thing that threatens your life, to see it as a
  cosmic force, so much larger than yourself, more powerful, created by elemental
  and willful rhythms.
- I'd never heard him go on about something with such spirited enjoyment. He was practically
  giddy. He must have known we could all die. Was this some kind of end-of-the-world
  elation? Did he seek distraction from his own small miseries in some violent and
  overwhelming event? His voice betrayed a craving for terrible things.
- Well-lighted men and women stood by the huge window looking out at us and wondering.
  It made us feel like fools, like tourists doing all the wrong things. Why were they
  content to shop for furniture while we sat panicky in slowpoke traffic in a snowstorm?
  They knew something we didn't. In a crisis the true facts are whatever other people
  say they are. No one's knowledge is less secure than your own.
- "\"These things happen to poor people who live in exposed areas. Society is set
  up in such a way that it's the poor and the uneducated who suffer the main impact
  of natural and man-made disasters. People in low-lying areas get the floods, people
  in shanties get the hurricanes and tornados. I'm a college professor. Did you ever
  see a college professor rowing a boat down his own street in one of those TV floods?
  We live in a neat and pleasant town near a college with a quaint name. These things
  don't happen in places like Blacksmith.”"
- What good is knowledge if it just floats in the air? It goes from computer to computer.
  It changes and grows every second of every day. But nobody actually knows anything.
- Some of the houses in town were showing signs of neglect. The park benches needed
  repair, the broken streets needed resurfacing. Signs of the tìmes. But the supermarket
  did not change, except for the better. It was well-stocked, musical and bright.
  This was the key, it seemed to us. Everything was fine, would continue to be fine,
  would eventually get even better as long as the supermarket did not slip.
- "\"How strange it is. We have these deep terrible lingering fears about ourselves
  and the people we love. Yet we walk around, talk to people, eat and drink. We manage
  to function. The feelings are deep and real. Shouldn't they paralyze us? How is
  it we can survive them, at least for a while? We drive a car, we teach a class.
  How is it no one sees how deeply afraid we were, last night, this morning? Is it
  something we all hide from each other, by mutual consent? Or do we share the same
  secret without knowing it? Wear the same disguise.”"
- This was the night the insane asylum burned down. Heinrich and I got in the car
  and went to watch. There were other men at the scene with their adolescent boys.
  Evidently fathers and sons seek fellowship at such events. Fires help draw them
  closer, provide a conversational wedge. There is equipment to appraise, the technique
  of firemen to discuss and criticize. The manliness of firefighting—the virility
  of fires, one might say—suits the kind of laconic dialogue that fathers and sons
  can undertake without awkwardness or embarrassment.
- Babette would watch from a window, managing to express love, worry, exasperation
  and despair, hope and gloom, more or less simultaneously. Vernon had only to shift
  his weight to arouse in her a series of extreme emotions.
