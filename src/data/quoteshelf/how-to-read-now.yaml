quotes:
- 'There is only so much space I can make for this controversy, both in these pages
  and in my life; controversies like this go beyond racial microaggressions—they''ve
  become predictable and occasionally lucrative trauma engines, and continually asking
  writers of color to produce a comment from the hot-take jukebox on the latest fuckup
  perpetrated by a dementedly racist and tone-deaf publishing industry is asking those
  writers to wipe a shit they did not take. What I''m much more curious about is what
  these fuckups reveal about readership: who we expect our readers to be, what we
  expect our readers to do, and how this might change.'
- 'When white readers claim to be made uncomfortable—as many I heard from claimed—by
  the presence of something like untranslated words in fiction, what they''re really
  saying is: *I have always been the expected reader*. A reader like this is used
  to the practice of reading being one that may performatively challenge them, much
  the way a safari guides a tourist through the "wilderness"—but ultimately always
  prioritizes their comfort and understanding.'
- 'That art should not serve to make us comfortable is such a basic argument I''m
  loathe to even repeat it. Yet the arguments about the comforts or disruptions of
  art cannot be held in good faith if we don''t address the fact that a white supremacist
  reading culture means we are conditioned to accept that some of our work is in fact
  routinely expected to comfort; that the work of writers of color must often in some
  way console, educate, provide new definitions, great epiphanies, and, most of all—that
  buzzword of both the commercial marketplace and political theater—be relevant. Whereas
  the work of white writers must be free to: offend, transgress, be exempt, be beyond
  politics, beyond identity—to delight, in other words, in the myriad fruits of its
  political immunity. And their readers must, in turn, always extend empathy toward
  that lucrative and culturally rewarded immunity—which is, after all, great art.'
- 'The logic of empathy says "I feel your pain"—but the logic of inheritance knows
  this transaction has always been corrupt at its core. The story I''m telling is
  not just something for you to feel sympathy for, rage against, be educated by: *it''s
  a story about you, too*. This work has left a will, and we are all of us named in
  it: the inheritances therein belong to every reader, every writer, every citizen.
  So, too, the world we get to make from it.'
- The problem is, if we need fiction to teach us empathy, we don't really have empathy,
  because empathy is not a one-stop destination; it's a practice, ongoing, which requires
  work from us in our daily lives, for our daily lives—not just when we're confronted
  with the visibly and legibly Other. Not just when a particularly gifted author has
  managed to make a community's story come alive for the reader who's come for a quick
  zoo visit, always remaining on her side of the cage.
- 'White supremacy is a comprehensive cultural education whose primary function is
  to prevent people from reading—engaging with, understanding—the lives of people
  outside its scope. This is even more apparent in the kind of reading most enthusiastically
  trafficked by the white liberal literary community that has such an outsize influence,
  intellectually and economically, on the publishing industry today. The unfortunate
  influence of this style of reading has dictated that we go to writers of color for
  the gooey heart-porn of the ethnographic: to learn about forgotten history, harrowing
  tragedy, community-destroying political upheaval, genocide, trauma; that we expect
  those writers to provide those intellectual commodities the way their ancestors
  once provided spices, minerals, precious stones, and unprecious bodies.'
- I've very often seen successful people of color framing their experiences of being
  the only person of color in their classrooms as narratives about struggle, rather
  than *also* being narratives about class and power; I emphasize *often*, because
  it seems to me that in fact many successful people of color in our mainstream media
  happen to be precisely the sort of people who grew up the only person of color in
  white towns. It is precisely *because* they grew up adjacent to whiteness and its
  social and economic privilege, precisely *because* they were well versed at an early
  age on how to adapt to and accommodate whiteness that they could thus use those
  skills as professional adults, living under white supremacy.
- But the idea that fiction builds empathy is one of incomplete politics, left hanging
  by probably good intentions. The concept of instrumentalizing fiction or art as
  a kind of ethical protein shake, such that reading more and more diversely will
  somehow build the muscles in us that will help us see other people as human, makes
  a kind of superficial sense—and produces a superficial effect. The problem with
  this type of reading is that in its practical application, usually readers are encouraged—by
  well-meaning teachers and lazy publishing copy—to read writers of a demographic
  minority in order to *learn* things; which is to say, as a supplement for their
  empathy muscles, a metabolic exchange that turns writers of color into little more
  than ethnographers—personal trainers, to continue the metaphor. The result is that
  we largely end up going to writers of color to learn the specific—and go to white
  writers to feel the universal.
