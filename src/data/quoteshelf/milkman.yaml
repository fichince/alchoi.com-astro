quotes:
- Some too, would make mention of the actual word 'rumour', as in ‘Rumour says', before
  going on to personify rumour, as if it wasn't they who were launching or perpetuating
  Rumour themselves.
- So shiny was bad, and 'too sad' was bad, and 'too joyous' was bad, which meant you
  had to go around not being anything; also not thinking, least not at top level,
  which was why everybody kept their private thoughts safe and sound in those recesses
  underneath.
- I was too buzzy to read, thinking of teacher, of her manner of saying there were
  sunsets every day, that we weren't meant to be coffined and buried whilst all the
  time still living, that nothing of the dark was so enormous that never could we
  surmount it, that always there were new chapters, that we must let go the old, open
  ourselves to symbolism, to the most unexpected of interpretations, that we must
  too uncover what we've kept hidden, what we think we might have lost.
- He made lewd remarks about me to me from the first moment he met me —about my quainte,
  my tail, my contry, my box, my jar, my contrariness, my monosyllable—and he used
  words, words sexual, I did not understand.
- As someone, a very ordinary person from 'over the road', once said on TV, succinctly
  too, because he wanted to a kill person of my religion in my area—which meant everybody
  in my area—in retaliation for some renouncer-of-the-state from my area walking over
  the road and bombing to death many people of his religion in his area, 'It's amazing
  the feelings that are in you.' And he was right. It is amazing, no matter it may
  not be yourself who pulls the trigger in the end.
