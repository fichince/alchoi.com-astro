title: Born a Crime
author: Trevor Noah
quotes:
- It taught me that it is easier to be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider
  as an insider. If a white guy chooses to immerse himself in hip-hop culture and
  only hang out with black people, black people will say, "Cool, white guy. Do what
  you need to do." If a black guy chooses to button up his blackness and live among
  white people and play lots of golf, white people will say, "Fine. I like Brian.
  He's safe." But try being a black person who immerses himself in white culture while
  still living in the black community. Try being a white person who adopts the trappings
  of black culture while still living in the white community. You will face more hate
  and ridicule and ostracism than you can even begin to fathom. People are willing
  to accept you if they see you as an outsider trying to assimilate into their world.
  But when they see you as a fellow tribe member attempting to disavow the tribe,
  that is something they will never forgive.
