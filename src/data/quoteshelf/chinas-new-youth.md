title: China's New Youth
author: Alec Ash
quotes:
- 'When Xiaoxiao started middle school, everything changed. Her dolls were taken away,
  TV was restricted and the fruit storeroom she played in became off bounds. The shift
  was so sudden that Xiaoxiao remembers thinking she was being punished for an unknown
  crime. Overnight, the pampering she was used to transformed into the true legacy
  of the only-child generation: crippling study pressure. Early childhood is a protected
  time, but the fairy tale crumbles as soon as you are old enough to hit the books
  twelve hours a day. ''Knowledge changes destiny,'' Xiaoxiao''s mother used to tell
  her at dinner, a familiar saying.'
