author: Jeff VanderMeer
quotes:
- We had also been ordered not to share our journal entries with one another. Too
  much shared information could skew our observations, our superiors believed. But
  I knew from experience how hopeless this pursuit, this attempt to weed out bias,
  was. Nothing that lived and breathed was truly objective—even in a vacuum, even
  if all that possessed the brain was a self-immolating desire for the truth.
- All you heard was the low moaning. The effect of this cannot be understood without
  being there. The beauty of it cannot be understood, either, and when you see beauty
  in desolation it changes something inside you. Desolation tries to colonize you.
- '"I felt as if I were both freer than ever before and more constrained," one member
  of the expedition said. "I felt as if I could do anything *as long as I did not
  mind being watched.*"'
- '"Ghost bird, do you love me?" he whispered once in the dark, before he left for
  his expedition training, even though he was the ghost. "Ghost bird, do you need
  me?" I loved him, but I didn''t need him, and I thought that was the way it was
  supposed to be. A ghost bird might be a hawk in one place, a crow in another, depending
  on the context. The sparrow that shot up into the blue sky one morning might transform
  mid-flight into an osprey the next. This was the way of things here. There were
  no reasons so mighty that they could override the desire to be in accord with the
  tides and the passage of seasons and the rhythms underlying everything around me.'
- I didn't tell my husband my walk had a destination because I wanted to keep the
  lot for myself. There are so many things couples do from habit and because they
  are expected to, and I didn't mind those rituals. Sometimes I even enjoyed them.
  But I needed to be selfish about that patch of urban wilderness. It expanded in
  mind while I was at work, calmed me, gave me a series of miniature dramas to look
  forward to. I didn't know that while I was applying this Band-Aid to my need to
  be unconfined, my husband was dreaming of Area X and much greater open spaces. But,
  later, the parallel helped assuage my anger at his leaving, and then my confusion
  when he came back in such a changed form… even if the stark truth is that I still
  did not truly understand what I had missed about him.
