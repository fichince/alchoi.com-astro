title: 'Exit West'
author: Mohsin Hamid
quotes:
- There was no physical violence in Nadia's home, and much giving to charity, but
  when after finishing university Nadia announced, to her family's utter horror, and
  to her own surprise for she had not planned to say it, that she was moving out on
  her own, an unmarried woman, the break involved hard words on all sides, from her
  father, from her mother, even more so from her sister, and perhaps most of all from
  Nadia herself, such that Nadia and her family both considered her thereafter to
  be without a family, something all of them, all four, for the rest of their lives,
  regretted, but which none of them would ever act to repair, partly out of stubbornness,
  partly out of bafflement at how to go about doing so, and partly because the impending
  descent of their city into the abyss would come before they realized that they had
  lost the chance.
- 'It was the sort of view that might command a slight premium during gentler, more
  prosperous times, but would be most undesirable in times of conflict, when it would
  be squarely in the path of heavy machine-gun and rocket fire as fighters advanced
  into this part of town: a view like staring down the barrel of a rifle. Location,
  location, location, the realtors say. Geography is destiny, respond the historians.'
- It might seem odd that in cities teetering at the edge of the abyss young people
  still go to class—in this case an evening class on corporate identity and product
  branding—but that is the way of things, with cities as with life, for one moment
  we are pottering about our errands as usual and the next we are dying, and our eternally
  impending ending does not put a stop to our transient beginnings and middles until
  the instant when it does.
- So he was unprepared for the feeling of awe that came over him, the wonder with
  which he then regarded his own skin, and the lemon tree in its clay pot on Nadia's
  terrace, as tall as he was, and rooted in its soil, which was in turn rooted in
  the clay of the pot, which rested upon the brick of the terrace, which was like
  the mountaintop of this building, which was growing from the earth itself, and from
  this earthy mountain the lemon tree was reaching up, up, in a gesture so beautiful
  that Saeed was filled with love, and reminded of his parents, for whom he suddenly
  felt such gratitude, and a desire for peace, that peace should come for them all,
  for everyone, for everything, for we are so fragile, and so beautiful, and surely
  conflicts could be healed if others had experiences like this, and then he regarded
  Nadia and saw that she was regarding him and her eyes were like worlds.
- But Saeed's father was thinking also of the future, even though he did not say this
  to Saeed, for he feared that if he said this to his son that his son might not go,
  and he knew above all else that his son must go, and what he did not say was that
  he had come to that point in a parent's life when, if a flood arrives, one knows
  one must let go of one's child, contrary to all the instincts one had when one was
  younger, because holding on can no longer offer the child protection, it can only
  pull the child down, and threaten them with drowning, for the child is now stronger
  than the parent, and the circumstances are such that the utmost of strength is required,
  and the arc of a child's life only appears for a while to match the arc of a parent's,
  in reality one sits atop the other, a hill atop a hill, a curve atop a curve, and
  Saeed's father's arc now needed to curve lower, while his son's still curved higher,
  for with an old man hampering them these two young people were simply less likely
  to survive.
- Saeed for his part wished he could do something for Nadia, could protect her from
  what would come, even if he understood, at some level, that to love is to enter
  into the inevitability of one day not being able to protect what is most valuable
  to you.
- Every time a couple moves they begin, if their attention is still drawn to one another,
  to see each other differently, for personalities are not a single immutable color,
  like white or blue, but rather illuminated screens, and the shades we reflect depend
  much on what is around us.
- There was also closeness, for the end of a couple is like a death, and the notion
  of death, of temporariness, can remind us of the value of things, which it did for
  Saeed and Nadia, and so even though they spoke less and did less together, they
  saw each other more, although not more often.
- But while fear was part of what kept them together for those first few months in
  Marin, more powerful than fear was the desire that each see the other find firmer
  footing before they let go, and thus in the end their relationship did in some senses
  come to resemble that of siblings, in that friendship was its strongest element,
  and unlike many passions, theirs managed to cool slowly, without curdling into its
  reverse, anger, except intermittently. Of this, in later years, both were glad,
  and both would also wonder if this meant that they had made a mistake, that if they
  had but waited and watched their relationship would have flowered again, and so
  their memories took on potential, which is of course how our greatest nostalgias
  are born.
