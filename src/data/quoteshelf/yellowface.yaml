title: 'Yellowface'
author: R. F. Kuang
quotes:
- Deep down, I've always suspected Athena likes my company precisely because I can't
  rival her. I understand her world, but I'm not a threat, and her achievements are
  so far out of my reach that she doesn't feel bad squealing to my face about her
  wins. Don't we all want a friend who won't ever challenge our superiority, because
  they already know it's a lost cause? Don't we all need someone we can treat as a
  punching bag?
- '"And it''s like, she just *gets* me, like she''s having sex with my words. Like,
  mind sex." Athena giggles, then scrunches her nose up adorably. I suppress the impulse
  to poke it. "You ever think of the revision process as like, having sex with your
  editor? Like you''re making a great big literary baby?"'
- But enter professional publishing, and suddenly writing is a matter of professional
  jealousies, obscure marketing budgets, and advances that don't measure up to those
  of your peers. Editors go in and mess around with your words, your vision. Marketing
  and publicity make you distill hundreds of pages of careful, nuanced reflection
  into cute, tweet-size talking points. Readers inflict their own expectations, not
  just on the story, but on your politics, your philosophy, your stance on all things
  ethical. You, not your writing, become the productâ€”your looks, your wit, your quippy
  clapbacks and factional alignments with online beefs that no one in the real world
  gives a shit about.
- When you've got a project in your jaws, a full-time writing schedule feels like
  a blessing. But when you're struggling to come up with a concept, the hours feel
  suffocating, accusatory. Time should be flying by as you sit wild-eyed at your laptop,
  possessed by the muse, pouring out your magnum opus. Instead the seconds creep to
  a halt.
