quotes:
- That most Substance-addicted people are also addicted to thinking, meaning they
  have a compulsive and unhealthy relationship with their own thinking.
- My chest bumps like a dryer with shoes in it.
- Try to learn to let what is unfair teach you.
- Like most North Americans of his generation, Hal tends to know way less about why
  he feels certain ways about the objects and pursuits he’s devoted to than he does
  about the objects and pursuits themselves. It’s hard to say for sure whether this
  is even exceptionally bad, this tendency.
- This wise old whiskery fish swims up to three young fish and goes, ‘Morning, boys,
  how’s the water?’ and swims away; and the three young fish watch him swim away and
  look at each other and go, ‘What the fuck is water?’ and swim away.
- Everyone should get at least one good look at the eyes of a man who finds himself
  rising toward what he wants to pull down to himself.
- Good old traditional audio-only phone conversations allowed you to presume that
  the person on the other end was paying complete attention to you while also permitting
  you not to have to pay anything even close to complete attention to her.
- The moment he recognized what exactly was on one cartridge he had a strong anxious
  feeling that there was something more entertaining on another cartridge and that
  he was potentially missing it. He realized that he would have plenty of time to
  enjoy all the cartridges, and realized intellectually that the feeling of deprived
  panic over missing something made no sense.
- That if you do something nice for somebody in secret, anonymously, without letting
  the person you did it for know it was you or anybody else know what it was you did
  or in any way or form trying to get credit for it, it’s almost its own form of intoxicating
  buzz.
- 'A U.S. of modern A. where the State is not a team or a code, but a sort of sloppy
  intersection of desires and fears, where the only public consensus a boy must surrender
  to is the acknowledged primacy of straight-line pursuing this flat and short-sighted
  idea of personal happiness: ‘The happy pleasure of the person alone, yes?’'
- It now lately sometimes seemed like a kind of black miracle to me that people could
  actually care deeply about a subject or pursuit, and could go on caring this way
  for years on end. Could dedicate their entire lives to it. It seemed admirable and
  at the same time pathetic. We are all dying to give our lives away to something,
  maybe.
- 'If you are an adolescent, here is the trick to being neither quite a nerd nor quite
  a jock: be no one. It is easier than you think.'
- Never trust a man on the subject of his own parents. As tall and basso as a man
  might be on the outside, he nevertheless sees his parents from the perspective of
  a tiny child, still, and will always. And the unhappier his childhood was, the more
  arrested will be his perspective on it.
- 'No one single instant of it was unendurable. Here was a second right here: he endured
  it. What was undealable-with was the thought of all the instants all lined up and
  stretching ahead, glittering.'
