title: Less is More
author: Jason Hickel
quotes:
- 'We tend to take the idea of growth for granted because it sounds so natural. And
  it is. All living organisms grow. But in nature there is a self-limiting logic to
  growth: organisms grow to a point of maturity, and then maintain a state of healthy
  equilibrium. When growth fails to stop – when cells keep replicating just for the
  sake of it – it’s because of a coding error, like what happens with cancer. This
  kind of growth quickly becomes deadly.'
