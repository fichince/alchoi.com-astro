quotes:
- “We live in a universe driven by chance," his father had said once, "but the bullshit
  artists all want causality." Bullshit artist in this context meant his mother, but
  the statement had wide applications.
- 'There came a distant shout across the river, and an even-more distant reply. Something
  small snuffled and quorked its way through the reeds to his right. A deep breath
  of fresh air was limned by a faint but sharp marsh smell. It was the kind of place
  where he and his father would have gone canoeing when he was a teenager. It wasn''t
  true wilderness, was comfortingly close to civilization, but existed just enough
  apart to create a boundary. This was what most people wanted: to be *close to* but
  not *part of*. They didn''t want the fearful unknown of a "pristine wilderness."
  They didn''t want a soulless artificial life, either.'
- In college, what had always stuck him in Astronomy 101 was that the first astronomers
  to think of points of light not as part of a celestial tapestry revolving around
  the earth but as individual stars had had to wrench their imaginations—and thus
  their analogies and metaphors—out of a grooved track that had been running through
  everyone's minds for hundreds and hundreds of years.
