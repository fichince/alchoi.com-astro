quotes:
- If Dad had been present, he'd undoubtedly have commented that most of the adults
  present were "dangerously close to relinquishing their dignity" and that it was
  sad and disturbing, because "they were all searching for something they'd never
  recognize, even if they found it." Dad was notoriously severe when it came to commenting
  upon the behaviors of all people other than himself. Yet, watching a midforties
  Wonder Woman stumble backward into Hannah's neat stack of *Traveler* magazines made
  me wonder if the very idea of Growing Up was a sham, the bus out of town you're
  so busy waiting for, you don't notice it never actually comes.
- Dad picked up women the way certain wool pants can't help but pick up lint.
- The phenomenon of Dad interacting with a beautiful woman was always an odd, sort
  of uninspired chemical experiment. Most of the time there was no reaction. Other
  times, Dad and the woman might *appear* to react vigorously, producing heat, light
  and gas. But at the end, there was never a functional product like plastics or glassware,
  only a foul stench.
- Obviously, being able to simply              was a skill supremely underestimated
  in the Western world. As Dad was fond of pointing out, in America, apart from those
  who won the lottery, generally all Winners were in possession of a strident voice,
  which was successfully used to overpower the thrum of all the competing voices,
  thereby producing a country that was insanely loud, so loud, most of the time no
  actual meaning could be discernedâ€”only "nationwide white noise." And thus when you
  met someone who listened, someone content to do nothing but              , so overwhelming
  was the difference, you had the startling and quite lonely epiphany that everyone
  else, every person you'd encountered since the day you were born who'd *supposedly*
  listened, had not really been listening to you at all. They'd been subtly checking
  out their own reflection in the glass bureau a little to the west of your head,
  thinking what they had to do later that evening, or deciding that next, as soon
  as you shut up, they were going to tell that classic story about their bout of Bangladeshi
  beachside dysentery, thereby showcasing how worldly, how wild (not to mention how
  utterly enviable) a human being they were.
- Such things as anguish, woe, affliction, guilt, feelings of awfulness and utter
  wretchedness, the bread and butter of Days of Yore and Russians, sadly have very
  little staying power in these lickety-split Modern Times.
