quotes:
- Then I think about how much I have wanted from men. How much of that wanting was
  what I wanted from myself, from other women, even; how much of what I thought I
  wanted from a lover came from what I needed from my own mother. Because it's women,
  in many of the stories I've heard, who have greater hold over other women than men
  have. We can make each other feel dowdy, whorish, unclean, unloved, not beautiful.
  In the end, it all comes down to fear. Men can frighten us, other women can frighten
  us, and sometimes we worry so much about what frightens us that we wait to have
  an orgasm until we are alone. We pretend to want things we don't want so nobody
  can see us not getting what we need.
- Men did not merely want. Men *needed*. The man who followed my mother to and from
  work every day *needed* to do so. Presidents forfeit glory for blow jobs. Everything
  a man takes a lifetime to build he may gamble for a moment. I have never entirely
  subscribed to the theory that powerful men have such outsize egos that they cannot
  suppose they will ever be caught; rather, I think that the desire is so strong in
  the instant that everything else—family, home, career—melts down into a little liquid
  cooler and thinner than semen. Into nothing.
- It's the nuances of desire that hold the truth of who we are at our rawest moments.
  I set out to register the heat and sting of female want so that men and other women
  might more easily comprehend before they condemn. Because it's the quotidian minutes
  of our lives that will go on forever, that will tell us who we were, who our neighbors
  and our mothers were, when we were too diligent in thinking they were nothing like
  us.
