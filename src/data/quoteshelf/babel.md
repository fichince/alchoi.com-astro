title: Babel
author: R. F. Kuang
quotes:
- Translation means doing violence upon the original, means warping and distorting
  it for foreign, unintended eyes. So then where does that leave us? How can we conclude,
  except by acknowledging that an act of translation is then necessarily always an
  act of betrayal?
- "'Violence shows them how much we're willing to give up,' said Griffin. 'Violence
  is the only language they understand, because their system of extraction is inherently
  violent. Violence shocks the system. And the system cannot survive the shock. You
  have no idea what you're capable of, truly. You can't imagine how the world might
  shift unless you pull the trigger.'"
- The English made regular use of only two flavours—salty and not salty—and did not
  seem to recognize any of the others. For a country that profited so well from trading
  in spices, its citizens were violently averse to actually using them; in all his
  time in Hampstead, he never tasted a dish that could be properly described as 'seasoned',
  let alone 'spicy'.
- As long as Professor Lovell did not accept him as a son, Robin would not attempt
  to claim him as a father. A lie was not a lie if it was never uttered; questions
  that were never asked did not need answers. They would both remain perfectly content
  to linger in the liminal, endless space between truth and denial.
- For Robin, such abstract reasoning was a reason to divest from the world, to retreat
  into the safety of dead languages and books. For Griffin, it was a rallying call.
