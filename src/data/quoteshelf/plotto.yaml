- 'Plotto, as a Method of plot suggestion for writers of creative fiction, is founded
  upon this law: Purpose, expressed or implied, opposing Obstacle, expressed or implied,
  yields Conflict.'
- 'There is one Supreme Purpose in every life: TO LIVE; and there is one Supreme Obstacle
  each life encounters: DEATH.'
