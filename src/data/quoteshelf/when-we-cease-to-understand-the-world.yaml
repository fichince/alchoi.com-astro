quotes:
- "[The night gardener] had also gone through a bad divorce, become estranged from
  his only daughter and been diagnosed with skin cancer, but he insisted that all
  of that, however painful, was secondary to the sudden realization that it was mathematics—not
  nuclear weapons, computers, biological warfare or our climate  Armageddon—which
  was changing our world to the point where, in a couple of decades at most, we would
  simply not be able to grasp what being human really meant."
- Take quantum mechanics, the crown jewel of our species, the most accurate, far-ranging
  and beautiful of all our physical theories. It lies behind the supremacy of our
  smartphones, behind the Internet, behind the coming promise of godlike computing
  power. It has completely reshaped our world. We know how to use it, it works as
  if by some strange miracle, and yet there is not a human soul, alive or dead, who
  actually gets it. The mind cannot come to grips with its paradoxes and contradictions.
  It's as if the theory had fallen to earth from another planet, and we simply scamper
  around it like apes, toying and playing with it, but with no true understanding.
- 'The night gardener once asked me if I knew how citrus trees died: when they reach
  old age, if they are not cut down and they manage to survive drought, disease and
  innumerable attacks of pests, fungi and plagues, they succumb from overabundance.
  When they come to the end of their life cycle, they put out a final, massive crop
  of lemons. In their last spring their flowers bud and blossom in enormous bunches
  and fill the air with a smell so sweet that it stings your nostrils from two blocks
  away; then their fruits ripen all at once, whole limbs break off due to their excessive
  weight, and after a few weeks the ground is covered with rotting lemons. It is a
  strange sight, he said, to see such exuberance before death. One can picture it
  in animal species, those million salmon mating and spawning before dropping dead,
  or the billions of herrings that turn the seawater white with their sperm and eggs
  and cover the coasts of the northeast Pacific for hundreds of miles. But trees are
  very different organisms, and such displays of overripening feel out of character
  for a plant and more akin to our own species, with its uncontrolled, devastating
  growth. I asked him how long my own citrus had to live. He told me that there was
  no way to know, at least not without cutting it down and looking inside its trunk.
  But, really, who would want to do that?'
- If matter were prone to birthing monsters of this kind, Schwarzschild asked with
  a trembling voice, were there correlations with the human psyche? Could a sufficient
  concentration of human will—millions of people exploited for a single end with their
  minds compressed into the same psychic space—unleash something comparable to the
  singularity?
