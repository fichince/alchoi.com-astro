title: 'Trick Mirror: Reflections on Self-Delusion'
author: Jia Tolentino
quotes:
- I have wondered if we're entering a period in which the line between valuing a woman
  *in the face of* mistreatment and valuing her *because* of that mistreatment is
  blurring; if the legitimate need to defend women from unfair criticism has morphed
  into an illegitimate need to defend women from criticism categorically; if it's
  become possible to praise a woman specifically because she is criticized—for that
  featureless fact alone.
- The conventional vision of a woman's life, in which the wedding plays a starring
  role, seems to be offering an unspoken tradeoff. Here, our culture says, is an event
  that will center you absolutely—that will crystallize your image when you were young
  and gorgeous, admired and beloved, with the whole world rolling out in front of
  you like an endless meadow, like a plush red carpet, sparklers lighting up your
  irises and petals drifting through your lavish, elegant hair. In exchange, from
  that point forward, in the eyes of the state and everyone around you, your needs
  will slowly cease to exist.
- 'It''s possible that, just as marriage conceals its true nature through the elaborate
  ritual of the wedding, I have been staging this entire production to hide from myself
  some reality about my life. If I object to the wife''s diminishment for the same
  reason that I object to the bride''s glorification, maybe this reason is much simpler
  and more obvious than I''ve imagined: I don''t want to be diminished, and I *do*
  want to be glorified—not in one shining moment, but whenever I want.'
- Provided with a feminist praxis of individual advancement and satisfaction—two concepts
  that easily blur into self-promotion and self-indulgence—women happily bit. A politics
  built around getting and spending money is sexier than a politics built around politics.
- 'And here one of the most soul-crushing things about the Trump era reveals itself:
  to get through it with any psychological stability—to get through it without routinely
  descending into an emotional abyss—a person''s best strategy is to think mostly
  of himself, herself. As wealth continues to flow upward, as Americans are increasingly
  shut out of their own democracy, as political action is constrained into online
  spectacle, I have felt so many times that the choice of this era is to be destroyed
  or to morally compromise ourselves in order to be functional—to be wrecked, or to
  be functional for reasons that contribute to the wreck.'
- "*It's hard to draw the line between taking pleasure in God's purpose and aligning
  God's purpose with what I take pleasure in*, I wrote, between entries where I tried
  to understand if it was inherently wrong to get drunk. (At my school, you could
  be expelled for character-based spiritual offenses such as partying, being gay,
  or getting pregnant.) I stood between both sides of my life, holding the lines that
  led to them, trying to engage with a tension that I stopped being able to feel.
  Eventually, almost without realizing it, I let one side go."
- "[…] the fact that everything feels like God to me ensured that I would not remain
  a Christian. Church never felt much more like virtue than drugs did, and drugs never
  felt much more sinful than church."
- |-
  The nature of a revelation is that you don't have to re-experience it; you don't even have to believe whatever is revealed to hang on to it for as long as you want. In the seventies, researchers believed that MDMA treatment would be discrete and limited—that once you got the message, as they put it, you could hang up the phone. You would be better for having listened. You would be changed.

  They don't say this about religion, but they should.
