title: 'Two Trees Make a Forest: In Search of My Family''s Past Among Taiwan''s Mountains
  and Coasts'

quotes:
- Two years later, the first Gray-Milne seismometer was installed in Taipei--renamed
  Taihoku by the Japanese--enabling the official collection of seismic data on the
  island.
- So when the forests disappear from the slopes, the mountains, too, are not long
  for this world. Landslides tell us how little is eternal.
- 'In Taiwan, though so much had changed, my mother became a person with a topographic
  history, a person set into the scene in which she believed she belonged. In my childhood,
  I never saw that in her: In forty years of life in Canada, she had never rooted
  to the place and got lost easily. On her commutes in rush-hour traffic, she did
  not stray from her prescribed path. But on the beach I realized that she''d carried
  something of the island in her the entire time, molecularly, absorbed the way water
  swells beneath the skin.'
- My mother, sister, and I stumbled over whether to call ourselves Chinese—we weren't
  from a China that exists any longer—or Taiwanese. No single word can contain the
  movements that carried our story across waters, across continents.
