quotes:
- “Bad news. A metavirus," Juanita says. "It's the atomic bomb of informational warfare—a
  virus that causes any system to infect itself with new viruses.”
- Why is the Deliverator so equipped? Because people rely on him. He is a role model.
  This is America. People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem
  with that? Because they have a right to. And because they have guns and no one can
  fucking stop them. As a result, this country has one of the worst economies in the
  world.
- 'The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory. He''s got esprit
  up to here. Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night.
  His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the
  air. A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio
  door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed
  forest. Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels
  like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.'
- Southern California doesn't know whether to bustle or just strangle itself on the
  spot.
- The cable is carrying a lot of information back and forth between Hiro's computer
  and the rest of the world. In order to transmit the same amount of information on
  paper, they would have to arrange for a 747 cargo freighter packed with telephone
  books and encyclopedias to power-dive into their unit every couple of minutes, forever.
- Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment.
  If you're ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful. If you've just gotten out of
  bed, your avatar can still be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied
  makeup. You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the
  Metaverse. Spend five minutes walking down the Street and you will see all of these.
- It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused
  by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.
- “I know. That's exactly the problem. Ninety-nine percent of everything that goes
  on in most Christian churches has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual religion.
  Intelligent people all notice this sooner or later, and they conclude that the entire
  one hundred percent is bullshit, which is why atheism is connected with being intelligent
  in people's minds."
- Besides, interesting things happen along borders—transitions—not in the middle where
  everything is the same.

  “Wait a minute, Juanita. Make up your mind. This Snow Crash thing—is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?"

  Juanita shrugs. "What's the difference?"

  Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.

  Hiro used to feel that way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this is liberating. He no longer has to worry about trying to be the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken.
- Hiro proceeds to the counter. A man is talking on the phone in Cantonese, which
  means that he is, in fact, shouting.
- We are all susceptible to the pull of viral ideas. Like mass hysteria. Or a tune
  that gets into your head that you keep on humming all day until you spread it to
  someone else. Jokes. Urban legends. Crackpot religions. Marxism. No matter how smart
  we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes us potential hosts
  for self-replicating information.
- "[Gargoyles] serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens
  around them. Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern-day equivalent
  of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user
  as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society."
- The world is full of power and energy and a person can go far by just skimming off
  a tiny bit of it.
- No matter how smart we get, there is always this deep irrational part that makes
  us potential hosts for self-replicating information.
- Software development, like professional sports, has a way of making thirty-year-old
  men feel decrepit.
- Condense fact from the vapor of nuance.
- This Snow Crash thing—is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?” Juanita shrugs. “What’s
  the difference?”
- "“She doesn't want you to understand her. She knows that's impossible. She just
  wants you to understand yourself. Everything else is negotiable.”"
- "“The problem with you hackers is you never stop working.” “That's what a hacker
  is,” Hiro says."
- "“Rife’s key realization was that there’s no difference between modern culture and
  Sumerian. We have a huge workforce that is illiterate or alliterate and relies on
  TV—which is sort of an oral tradition. And we have a small, extremely literate power
  elite—the people who go into the Metaverse, basically—who understand that information
  is power, and who control society because they have this semimystical ability to
  speak magic computer languages."
- "“Computers rely on the one and the zero to represent all things. This distinction
  between something and nothing—this pivotal separation between being and nonbeing—is
  quite fundamental and underlies many Creation myths.”"
- "“She doesn’t want you to understand her. She knows that’s impossible. She just
  wants you to understand yourself. Everything else is negotiable.”"
