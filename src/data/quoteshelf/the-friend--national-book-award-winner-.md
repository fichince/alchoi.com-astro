title: The Friend (National Book Award Winner)
author: Sigrid Nunez
quotes:
- "Is it true that the literary world is mined with hatred, a battlefield rimmed with
  snipers where jealousies and rivalries are always being played out? asked the NPR
  interviewer of the distinguished author. Who allowed that it was. There’s a lot
  of envy and enmity, the author said. And he tried to explain: It’s like a sinking
  raft that too many people are trying to get onto. So any push you can deliver makes
  the raft a little higher for you.\n\t\t\tIf reading really does increase empathy,
  as we are constantly being told that it does, it appears that writing takes some
  away"
