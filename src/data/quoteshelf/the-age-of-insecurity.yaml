title: The Age of Insecurity
author: Astra Taylor
quotes:
- 'Our success was predicated on keeping others down. Accolades, good grades, and
  opportunities all seemed to be in short supply, and as with all competitions for
  resources, there were winners and losers. But in school this competition is particularly
  absurd: knowledge, unlike food or water, can’t be used up, and the desire to learn
  isn’t a need that evolved to be satiated. The boundlessness of curiosity is what
  makes us learning animals; it is what makes us human. Curiosity is something we
  can safely be consumed by, since consuming knowledge enriches us without creating
  waste.'
- Security is not something that we can achieve heroically or stoically through consumption
  or recycling, education, medicine, or mindfulness. We cannot breathe our way out
  of our thorny social problems, nor can we amass enough wealth to wholly buffer ourselves
  from them; social media sabbaths, however appealing and temporarily soothing, do
  nothing to change the insecurity-generating logic of the algorithms that deliver
  us content. These strategies all leave us embedded in systems designed to generate
  and profit from the very insecurities we hope to escape.
- 'In their dedication, the Stoics revealed a fundamental contradiction: securitas,
  care’s absence, can only be achieved with effort. That is to say, with care.'
- To be human is to be perpetually insecure. Real securitas, the parable implies,
  can only be achieved in death, when our spirits return to Jupiter and our bodies
  to Tellus, freeing us from Cura’s influence. In other words, as long as we are alive,
  we are destined to exist in a condition of what I’ll call existential insecurity.
  This existential insecurity is the kind that comes from being dependent on others
  for survival; from being vulnerable to physical and psychological illness or wounding;
  and, of course, from being mortal. It’s the insecurity of randomness and risk, of
  a future that is impossible to control or to know. It is a kind of insecurity we
  can never wholly escape or armour ourselves against, try as we might to mitigate
  potential harms.
- This kind of insecurity, which I’ll call “manufactured insecurity,” is quite unlike
  the existential insecurity that is inherent to human life, as the myth of Cura underscores.
  Where the latter is an ineradicable feature of our being, the former is a mechanism
  that facilitates exploitation and profit and is anything but inevitable. Indeed,
  the insight that capitalism is a kind of insecurity-producing machine—that insecurity
  is not an unfortunate side effect but a core attribute of the system—is one that
  these chapters will return to and examine through different lenses.
- When we examine society through the lens of insecurity, which affects everyone,
  as opposed to inequality, which emphasizes two opposing extremes, we can see the
  degree to which unnecessary suffering is widespread even among those who appear
  to be “winning” according to the logic of the capitalist game.
- Manufactured insecurity reflects a cynical theory of human motivation, one that
  says people will work only under the threat of duress, not from an intrinsic desire
  to create, collaborate, and care for one another.
- 'The cost of wealth maintenance is cognitive dissonance: these are people who purport
  to hold progressive ideals while benefiting from a highly regressive tax code that
  they find morally objectionable. (In Canada, lax codes mean billionaires can pass
  their fortunes to their children essentially tax-free; America’s billionaires use
  a variety of accounting tricks to achieve the same result.) Our possessions, monetary
  and otherwise, have a way of possessing us and turning us into people we may not
  actually want to be.'
- Insecurity, both as a feeling and as a lived material experience, is what keeps
  the vast majority of people scurrying to catch up. The command to live life according
  to market priorities is so persuasive precisely because it is coupled with threats—threats
  of unemployment, destitution, shame, loss of status, and respect. Rapid economic
  changes and new technologies have multiplied our insecurities while also raising
  our expectations, increasing the risks of failure as a result. We follow the prescribed
  course—work, consume, save, strive—because we want to make our lives better, which
  is not the same thing as being selfish. In the absence of new pathways to security,
  we can only continue along the old routes, even as they are collapsing beneath our
  feet.
- We need the right to things, not just protection from threats. It is not enough
  to be granted the right not to be abused by our governments without the corresponding
  right to receive assistance; not enough to possess civil and political rights without
  social and economic ones as well.
- 'Private options appear to offer a quick, practical path to short-term security,
  but over time, they corrode the public system on which most people rely. It is what
  the ancient Greeks called a pharmakon, a word that refers to elixirs both noxious
  and healing, simultaneously poison and cure. This is the paradox of market medicine:
  even as it saves lives, it is structured to benefit from insecurity and suffering,
  and so simultaneously aggravates these underlying conditions while soothing the
  symptoms.'
- 'In the sixth century B.C., Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu warned: “Fill your bowl
  to the brim, and it will spill. Chase after money and security and your heart will
  never unclench.”'
- A sensitive and astute observer of emotions, Smith believed that the basic human
  desire for approval and admiration (in his words, “to be observed, to be attended
  to, to be taken notice of”) is what makes people yearn for material things in the
  first place. Thus, consumption and capitalism have always been less about stuff
  and self-interest (let alone efficiency and innovation) than they are about insecurity
  and self-esteem. Those who envy others wish themselves to be envied in turn, thinking
  it will bring them happiness and security. It is this social aspiration, Smith thought,
  not solipsistic greed, that pushes people to truck and trade.
- Our society assumes that we all need a promise to chase, some extrinsic incentive
  to drive us—an Instagrammable beach vacation, for example—lest we cause the wheels
  of commercial society to stop turning and economic growth to stall by lollygagging
  in the sun on the roadside. Sure, the system is based on a lie and makes even the
  winners miserable, but that’s why, Smith thought, it works so well.
- 'Capitalism thrives on bad feelings, on the knowledge that contented people buy
  less—an insight the old American trade magazine Printers’ Ink stated bluntly: “Satisfied
  customers are not as profitable as discontented ones.” Consumer society thus capitalizes
  on the very insecurities it produces, which it then prods and perpetuates, making
  us all insecure by design.'
- Where conventional Western education focuses on decontextualized knowledge and disembodied
  expertise, Nishnaabeg education, in Simpson’s words, emerges out of a “compassionate
  web of interdependent relationships that are different and valuable because of that
  difference.” Children learn as they live, observing their surroundings and their
  elders, who answer questions and ask them in return. As Simpson describes it, the
  result is a mode of learning that is both deeply communal and highly individualistic—an
  individualism that is not selfish or competitive but secure and collaborative.
- In a roundabout way, postmaterialists had prompted a right-wing resurgence. As Inglehart
  ruefully observed in 2017, paraphrasing Marx and Engels, postmaterialism had become
  “its own grave-digger.” Focused on making society more open, less discriminatory,
  and free during the 1960s and 1970s, postmaterialists ignored the first levels of
  Maslow’s pyramid of needs. Taking a baseline of material security for granted, they
  emphasized the importance of social inclusion and environmental sustainability over
  rudimentary bread-and-butter concerns.

  The question before us, really, is quite simple: Do we see ourselves as barons or commoners?

  In today’s world it can be hard to tell, largely because we are encouraged to see ourselves as barons-to-be.
