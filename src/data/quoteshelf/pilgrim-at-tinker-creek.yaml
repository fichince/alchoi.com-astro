title: Pilgrim at Tinker Creek
author: Annie Dillard
quotes:
- 'The creeks—Tinker and Carvin''s—are an active mystery, fresh every minute. Theirs
  is the mystery of the continuous creation and all that providence implies: the uncertainty
  of vision, the horror of the fixed, the dissolution of the present, the intricacy
  of beauty, the pressure of fecundity, the elusiveness of the free, and the flawed
  nature of perfection. The mountains— Tinker and Brushy, McAfee''s Knob and Dead
  Man—are a passive mystery, the oldest of all. Theirs is the one simple mystery of
  creation from nothing, of matter itself, anything at all, the given. Mountains are
  giant, restful, absorbent. You can heave your spirit into a mountain and the mountain
  will keep it, folded, and not throw it back as some creeks will. The creeks are
  the world with all its stimulus and beauty; I live there. But the mountains are
  home.'
- 'I sit on the downed tree and watch the black steers slip on the creek bottom. They
  are all bred beef: beef heart, beef hide, beef hocks. They''re a human product like
  rayon. They''re like a field of shoes. They have cast-iron shanks and tongues like
  foam insoles. You can''t see through to their brains as you can with other animals;
  they have beef fat behind their eyes, beef stew.'
- We don't know what's going on here. If these tremendous events are random combinations
  of matter run amok, the yield of millions of monkeys at millions of typewriters,
  then what is it in us, hammered out of those same typewriters, that they ignite?
  We don't know. Our life is a faint tracing on the surface of mystery, like the idle,
  curved tunnels of leaf miners on the face of a leaf. We must somehow take a wider
  view, look at the whole landscape, really see it, and describe what's going on here.
  Then we can at least wail the right question into the swaddling band of darkness,
  or, if it comes to that, choir the proper praise.
- 'I wonder how long it would take you to notice the regular recurrence of the seasons
  if you were the first man on earth. What would it be like to live in open-ended
  time broken only by days and nights? You could say, "it''s cold again; it was cold
  before," but you couldn''t make the key connection and say, "it was cold this time
  last year,” because the notion of "year" is precisely the one you lack. Assuming
  that you hadn''t yet noticed any orderly progression of heavenly bodies, how long
  would you have to live on earth before you could feel with any assurance that any
  one particular long period of cold would, in fact, end? "While the earth remaineth,
  seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night
  shall not cease": God makes this guarantee very early in Genesis to a people whose
  fears on this point had perhaps not been completely allayed.'
- It is still the first week in January, and I've got great plans. I've been thinking
  about seeing. There are lots of things to see, unwrapped gifts and free surprises.
  The world is fairly studded and strewn with pennies cast broadside from a generous
  hand. But—and this is the point—who gets excited by a mere penny? If you follow
  one arrow, if you crouch motionless on a bank to watch a tremulous ripple thrill
  on the water and are rewarded by the sight of a muskrat kit paddling from its den,
  will you count that sight a chip of copper only, and go your rueful way? It is dire
  poverty indeed when a man is so malnourished and fatigued that he won't stoop to
  pick up a penny. But if you cultivate a healthy poverty and simplicity, so that
  finding a penny will literally make your day, then, since the world is in fact planted
  in pennies, you have with your poverty bought a lifetime of days. It is that simple.
  What you see is what you get.
- At this latitude I'm spinning 836 miles an hour round the earth's axis; I often
  fancy I feel my sweeping fall as a breakneck arc like the dive of dolphins, and
  the hollow rushing of wind raises hair on my neck and the side of my face. In orbit
  around the sun I'm moving 64,800 miles an hour. The solar system as a whole, like
  a merry-go-round unhinged, spins, bobs, and blinks at the speed of 43,200 miles
  an hour along a course set east of Hercules. Someone has piped, and we are dancing
  a tarantella until the sweat pours.
- Only a piece of ashen moon occasionally climbs up or down the inside of the dome,
  and our local star without surcease explodes on our heads. We have really only that
  one light, one source for all power, and yet we must turn away from it by universal
  decree. Nobody here on the planet seems aware of this strange, powerful taboo, that
  we all walk about carefully averting our faces, this way and that, lest our eyes
  be blasted forever.
- It is winter proper; the cold weather, such as it is, has come to stay. I bloom
  indoors in the winter like a forced forsythia; I come in to come out. At night I
  read and write, and things I have never understood become clear; I reap the harvest
  of the rest of the year's planting.
- '"The people," wrote Van Gogh in a letter, "are very sensitive to the changing seasons."
  That we are "very sensitive to the changing seasons" is, incidentally, one of the
  few good reasons to shun travel. If I stay at home I preserve the illusion that
  what is happening on Tinker Creek is the very newest thing, that I''m at the very
  vanguard and cutting edge of each new season. I don''t want the same season twice
  in a row; I don''t want to know I''m getting last week''s weather, used weather,
  weather broadcast up and down the coast, old-hat weather.'
- It snowed. It snowed all yesterday and never emptied the sky, although the clouds
  looked so low and heavy they might drop all at once with a thud. The light is diffuse
  and hueless, like the light on paper inside a pewter bowl. The snow looks light
  and the sky dark, but in fact the sky is lighter than the snow. Obviously the thing
  illuminated cannot be lighter than its illuminator. The classical demonstration
  of this point involves simply laying a mirror flat on the snow so that it reflects
  in its surface the sky, and comparing by sight this value to that of the snow. This
  is all very well, even conclusive, but the illusion persists. The dark is overhead
  and the light at my feet; I'm walking upside-down in the sky.
- 'Self-consciousness is the curse of the city and all that sophistication implies.
  It is the glimpse of oneself in a storefront window, the unbidden awareness of reactions
  on the faces of other people—the novelist''s world, not the poet''s. I''ve lived
  there. I remember what the city has to offer: human companionship, major-league
  baseball, and a clatter of quickening stimulus like a rush from strong drugs that
  leaves you drained. I remember how you bide your time in the city, and think, if
  you stop to think, "next year. . . I''ll start living; next year. . . I''ll start
  my life." Innocence is a better world.'
- Fish gotta swim and bird gotta fly; insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing
  after another. I never ask why of a vulture or shark, but I ask why of almost every
  insect I see.
- 'The earth devotes an overwhelming proportion of its energy to these buzzings and
  leaps in the grass, to these brittle gnawings and crawlings about. Theirs is the
  biggest wedge of the pie: Why? I ought to keep a giant water bug in an aquarium
  on my dresser, so I can think about it. We have brass candlesticks in our houses
  now; we ought to display praying mantises in our churches. Why do we turn from the
  insects in loathing?'
- Nature is, above all, profligate. Don't believe them when they tell you how economical
  and thrifty nature is, whose leaves return to the soil. Wouldn't it be cheaper to
  leave them on the tree in the first place? This deciduous business alone is a radical
  scheme, the brainchild of a deranged manic-depressive with limitless capital. Extravagance!
  Nature will try anything once. This is what the sign of the insects says. No form
  is too gruesome, no behavior too grotesque. If you're dealing with organic compounds,
  then let them combine. If it works, if it quickens, set it clacking in the grass;
  there's always room for one more; you ain't so handsome yourself. This is a spendthrift
  economy; though nothing is lost, all is spent.
- Experiencing the present purely is being emptied and hollow; you catch grace as
  a man fills his cup under a waterfall.
- 'What if *I* fell in a forest: Would a tree hear?'
