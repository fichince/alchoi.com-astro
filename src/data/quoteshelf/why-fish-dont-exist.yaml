title: Why Fish Don't Exist
author: Lulu Miller
quotes:
- I wanted to have some amazing retort. Some grandstandy way of telling him how wrong
  he was. That we matter, we matter. But as soon as I’d feel my fist lifting, my brain
  would tug it back. Because of course, we don’t. We don’t matter. This is the cold
  truth of the universe. We are specks, flickering in and out of existence, with no
  significance to the cosmos. To ignore this truth is, oddly enough,  to behave exactly
  like David Starr Jordan, whose ridiculous belief in his own superiority allowed
  him to perpetrate such unthinkable violence. No, to be clear-eyed and Good was to
  concede with every breath, with every step, our insignificance. To say otherwise
  was to sin, to lie, to march oneself off toward delusion, madness, or worse.
- To some people a dandelion might look like a weed, but to others that same plant
  can be so much more. To an herbalist, it’s a medicine—a way of detoxifying the liver,
  clearing the skin, and strengthening the eyes. To a painter, it’s a pigment; to
  a hippie, a crown; a child, a wish. To a butterfly, it’s sustenance; to a bee, a
  mating bed; to an ant, one point in a vast olfactory atlas.
- The best way of ensuring that you don’t miss them, these gifts, the trick that has
  helped me squint at the bleakness and see them more clearly, is to admit, with every
  breath, that you have no idea what you are looking at. To examine each object in
  the avalanche of Chaos with curiosity, with doubt. Is this storm a bummer? Maybe
  it’s a chance to get the streets to yourself, to be licked by raindrops, to reset.
  Is this party as boring as I assume it will be? Maybe there will be a friend waiting,
  with a cigarette in her mouth, by the back door of the dance floor, who will laugh
  with you for years to come, who will transmute your shame to belonging.
- when I give up the fish, I realize that science itself is flawed. Not the beacon
  toward truth I had always thought it was, but a blunt tool that can wreak a lot
  of havoc along the way. Consider the word “order” itself. It comes from the Latin
  ordinem, to describe a row of threads sitting neatly in a loom. In time, it was
  extended as a metaphor to describe the way that people sit neatly under the rule
  of a king, general, or president. It was only applied to nature in the 1700s under
  the assumption—a human fabrication, a superimposition, a guess—that there is an
  orderly set of ranks to find there. I have come to believe that it is our life’s
  work to tear down this order, to keep tugging at it, trying to unravel it, to set
  free the organisms trapped underneath. That it is our life’s work to mistrust our
  measures. Especially those about moral and mental standing. To remember that behind
  every ruler there is a Ruler. To remember that a category is at best a proxy; at
  worst, a shackle

  What could be a grim reality has instead pumped his life full of vigor. Has made him live big and good. I have strived my whole life to follow in his nihilistic, clown-shoed footsteps. To stare our pointlessness in the face, and waddle along toward happiness because of it.
  But I haven’t always been so good at it.
  You don’t matter has often had a different effect on me
- And that, that is why David Starr Jordan called out to me. I wondered what it was
  that allowed him to keep plunging his sewing needle at Chaos, in spite of all the
  clear warnings that he would never prevail. I wondered if he had stumbled across
  some trick, some prescription for hope in an uncaring world. And because he was
  a scientist, I held on to the distant possibility that his justification for persistence,
  whatever it was, fit into my father’s worldview. Perhaps he had cracked something
  essential about how to have hope in a world of no promises, about how to carry forward
  on the darkest days. About how to have faith without Faith.
- 'At last I got my hands on what looked like the most promising lead. A small black
  book called The Philosophy of Despair. In it, David confesses that the trouble with
  the scientific worldview was that when you pointed it at the meaning of life, it
  showed you one thing. Futility: “The fires we kindle die away in coals; castles
  we build vanish before our eyes. The river sinks in the sands of the desert.… Whichever
  way we turn we may describe the course of life in metaphors of discouragement.”
  So what were you supposed to do?'
- He says that the problem with spending one’s time pondering the futility of it all
  is that you divert that precious electricity gifted to you by evolution—those sacred
  ions that could make you feel so many wonderful sensations and solve so many scientific
  puzzles—and you flush it all down the drain of existential inquiry, causing you
  to literally “die while the body is still alive.”
- He is promoted to higher and higher offices. The awards and medals start clattering
  in, for teaching, for ichthyology, for contributions to higher ed. An odd alchemy
  of delusion right before your eyes. Little lies transmuting into bronze, silver,
  gold. Forget millennia of warnings to stay humble; maybe this is just how it works
  in a godless system. Maybe David Starr Jordan is proof that a steady dose of hubris
  is the best way of overcoming doomed odds
- Had David followed his own advice to look to nature for truth, he would have seen
  it. This dazzling, feathery, squawking, gurgling mound of counterevidence. Animals
  can outperform humans on nearly every measure supposedly associated with our superiority.
  There are crows that have better memories than us, chimps with better pattern-recognition
  skills, ants that rescue their wounded, and blood flukes with higher rates of monogamy.
  When you actually examine the range of life on Earth, it takes a lot of acrobatics
  to sort it into a single hierarchy with humans at the top. We don’t have the biggest
  brain or the best memory. We’re not the fastest or the strongest or the most prolific.
  We’re not the only ones that mate for life, that show altruism, use tools, language.
  We don’t have the most copies of genes in circulation. We aren’t even the newest
  creation on the block.
