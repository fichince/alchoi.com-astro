quotes:
- 'From Emerson, I learned two fundamental truths: first, that *we learn by expressing,
  not by thinking*, which is to say that knowledge doesn''t really exist until you
  can write it down. What we normally imagine as "thinking" is really just a distracted
  form of writing, like having a disoriented drunk at a typewriter behind your eyes.
  Writing sobers him up. The pen (or the word processor) lets the mind compose language
  into knowledge that''s far more sophisticated than what that little boozer can do
  on his own.'
- There may be cyberspace in cyberpunk, but there's no social media. There may be
  surveillance, but there's resistance to it. Who could have guessed in the 1980s
  that we would choose to surveil ourselves, that we would happily give up every crumb
  of personal information for packages delivered a few days sooner and tailored search
  results? Cyberpunk offers a nostalgic escape from what is dystopic in our present,
  not by appealing to some idealized past, but by imagining an alternate timeline
  in which those things never came to pass.
- Life is not a zero-sum game between the freedoms of isolation and the stability
  of relationships, but there is some sacrifice of one for the other. I'm married,
  involved with my friends, close with my parents. I wouldn't change that, but it
  does mean I forgo some freedoms. I can't vanish for a week and not tell anyone.
  I can barely go that long without calling my mom! In certain ways, we're all limited
  by the people in our networksâ€”by their image of us, their expectations, their needs.
  In the last decade, I've learned just how much the benefits of good relationships
  outweigh their drawbacks, yet it doesn't surprise me that I sometimes fantasize
  about life without these limitations, that I want it both ways. For me, the city
  has always been the locus of this fantasy, the cyberpunk city its purest distillation.
- 'Our "appetite for the absolute" is always seeking outlets. The Lord of the Rings
  is one for me. Tolkien''s mythology imagines a world in which there *is* a design
  to creation, in which supernatural things *do* happen. To the extent that the story
  is immersive, the reader can participate in this alternate universe, escape into
  its meanings, without having to believe something untrue. That''s because the participation
  is literary, not actual. It''s sort of like a loophole: in art, you can indulge
  in the consolations reason denies in life.'
