quotes:
- A thought experiment courtesy of the Stoics. If you are tired of everything you
  possess, imagine that you have lost all these things.
- My love for her seemed doomed, hopelessly unrequited. There should be songs for
  this, I thought, but if there were I didn't know them.
- That was the summer it rained and rained. I remember the sad doggish smell of my
  sweater and my shoes sloshing crazily. And in every city, the same scene. A boy
  stepping into the street and opening an umbrella for girl keeping dry in the doorway.
- It was still months before we'd tell each other all our stories. And even then some
  seemed too small to bother with. So why do they come back to me now? Now, when I'm
  so weary of all of it.
- Another night. My old apartment in Brooklyn. It was late, but of course, I couldn't
  sleep. Above me, speed freaks merrily disassembling something. Leaves against the
  window. I felt a sudden chill and pulled the blanket over my head. That's the way
  they bring horses out of a fire, I remembered. If they can't see, they won't panic.
  I tried to figure out if I felt calmer with a blanket over my head. No I did not
  was the answer.
- There is a man who travels around the world trying to find places where you can
  stand still and hear no human sound. It is impossible to feel calm in cities, he
  believes, because we so rarely hear birdsong there. Our ears evolved to be our warning
  systems. We are on high alert in places where no birds sing. To live in a city is
  to be forever flinching.
- I gave you my favorite thing from Chinatown, pressed it drunkenly into your hand.
  We were in my kitchen that first night. BEAUTIFUL GAUZE MASK, the package said.
- That year I didn't travel alone. I'll meet you there, you said. But it was late
  when we spotted each other at the train station. You had a ten-dollar haircut. I
  was fatter than when I'd left. It seemed possible that we'd traveled across the
  world in error. We tried to reserve judgment.
- The baby's eyes were dark, almost black, and when I nursed her in the middle of
  the night, she'd stare at me with a stunned, shipwrecked look as if my body were
  the island she'd washed up on.
- I read a study once about sleep deprivation. The researchers made cat-sized islands
  of sand in the middle of a pool of water, then placed very tired cats on top of
  them. At first, the cats curled up perfectly on the sand and slept, but eventually
  they'd sprawl out and wake up in water. I can't remember what they were trying to
  prove exactly. All I took away was that the cats went crazy.

  I had this idea in the middle of the night that maybe I could stop working for the almost astronaut and get a job writing fortune cookies instead. I could try to write really American ones. Already, I've jotted down a few of them.

  Objects create happiness.

  The animals are pleased to be of use.

  Your cities will shine forever.

  Death will not touch you.
- I keep forgetting to get glasses. It makes my husband crazy. I ask my most stylish
  friend to come with me to pick them out. The salesman wants me to buy bright blue
  ones. Fashion forward, he calls them. My friend laughs. "I don't think they go with
  the way you dress.‚Äù How do I dress? I wonder. Like a bus driver is the answer.

  My friend who teaches writing sometimes flips out when she is grading stories and types the same thing over and over again.

  WHERE ARE WE IN TIME AND SPACE?

  WHERE ARE WE IN TIME AND SPACE?
- It is important if someone asks you to remember one of your happiest times to consider
  not only the question but also the questioner. If the question is asked by someone
  you love, it is fair to assume that this person hopes to feature in this recollection
  he has called forth. But you could, if you were wrong and if you had a crooked heart,
  forget this most obvious and endearing thing and instead speak of a time you were
  all alone, in the country, with no one wanting a thing from you, not even love.
  You could say that was your happiest time. And if  you did this then telling about
  this happiest of times would cause the person you most want to be happy to be unhappy.
- There is a husband who requires mileage receipts, another who wants sex at three
  a.m. One who forbids short haircuts, another who refuses to feed the pets. I would
  never put up with that, all the other wives think. Never. But my agent has a theory.
  She says every marriage is jerry-rigged. Even the ones that look reasonable from
  the outside are held together inside with chewing gum and wire and string.
- So now this woman at the playground is telling me about how her husband rifles through
  her purse for receipts. If he finds one for the wrong kind of ATM, he posts it on
  the refrigerator, highlighted in red. She shrugs. "He can't help it."
- There is nowhere to cry in this city. But the wife has an idea one day. There is
  a cemetery half a mile from their apartment. Perhaps one could wander through it
  sobbing without unnerving anyone. Perhaps one could flap one's hands even.

  The Zen master Ikkyu was once asked to write a distillation of the highest wisdom. He wrote only one word: *Attention.*

  The visitor was displeased. "Is that all?"

  So Ikkyu obliged him. Two words now.

  *Attention. Attention.*
