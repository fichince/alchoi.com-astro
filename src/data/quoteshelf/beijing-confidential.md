quotes:
- Luna sets me straight. "It's so my husband can concentrate on his job. It's supposed
  to preserve the stability of our marital relations." In other words, Lenovo pays
  Luna to stay home and keep her husband happy. I am stunned. I can't decide whether
  this is horribly retro—paying women to stay home—or wonderfully cutting-edge—putting
  a cash value on running a household. After Scarlet, Luna is the second person I
  know who just wants to be a housewife.
- Based on unscientific observations, I've noticed that a culture's personal space
  is inversely proportional to its population density. Take Finland, which has only
  one-third as many people as the entire city of Beijing. On a recent trip there with
  Sam's hockey team, I saw a Finnish man waiting impatiently—two meters behind a Canadian
  dad—at a salad bar in Lohja, population 41,400. The Canadian took his sweet time
  filling his plate, unaware someone was waiting for access to the pickled herring.
  In Canada, the salad-bar norm is about two bowls' distance. In China, the person
  behind you would be digging into the same bowl, then leapfrogging you in the line.
- Linguistically torturing offspring is an overseas Chinese tradition, the solemn
  duty of the Chinese diaspora.
- 'Ben says another reason for China''s rapid development is the lack of civic opposition.
  Before the masses fully wake to up the notion of property rights, the Communist
  Party is sending SWAT teams into neighborhoods armed with buckets of red paint.
  They daub a single character on any building destined for destruction: chai. It
  rhymes with "buy," and it means "demolish." The character is so ubiquitous that
  a British friend in Beijing tells me her little girl recently asked, "Mommy, is
  that why they call it Chai-na?"'
- These are the desperate dealing with the desperate. A middle-aged man picks through
  a mound of second-hand clothes. He tries on a pair of trousers over his shorts,
  and starts to bargain, hard. The vendor shakes his head. The man is insistent. He
  presses money into the hand of the vendor, who still refuses, pushing the crumpled
  bills back. Each side tenses. They are one yuan—fourteen cents—apart, and the difference
  matters to both.
- Alfred says he tolerates a moderate amount of corruption as a fact of doing business
  in Beijing. "If water is too clean, there are no fish," he explains, quoting another
  Chinese proverb.
- '"In Mao Zedong''s era, we worked so hard and we were always hungry," he says, swallowing
  a mouthful of Coke. "Now, as long as we don''t speak about politics, our economic
  development is fast. We say in five years the world market will be ours. Let them
  discuss politics at the very top of the government. We''d rather not ourselves."'
- I have heard of Rose Garden, on the outskirts of Beijing. It was renowned as the
  most expensive, over-the-top housing development in the city. Their villa had five
  bedrooms, six bathrooms, his-and-hers saunas, a table-tennis room, a pool-table
  room, a library and a swimming pool. He eventually realized it was too big and too
  much trouble. "When you don't have something, you really want it. When you get it,
  you realize how much work it is to have so much. It was so tiring to barbecue all
  the time. We had to clean the pool every two days. I had to sit with guests in the
  sauna. We had to buy lightbulbs by the case.”
