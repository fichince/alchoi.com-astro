title: Man's Search for Meaning
author: Viktor E. Frankl
quotes:
- 'On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking
  from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were
  prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and
  betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by
  the aid of many lucky chances or miracles—whatever one may choose to call them—we
  know: the best of us did not return.'
- I think it was Lessing who once said, “There are things which must cause you to
  lose your reason or you have none to lose.” An abnormal reaction to an abnormal
  situation is normal behavior.

  The corpse which had just been removed stared in at me with glazed eyes. Two hours before I had spoken to that man. Now I continued sipping my soup.

    If my lack of emotion had not surprised me from the standpoint of professional interest, I would not remember this incident now, because there was so little feeling involved in it.
- I shall never forget how I was roused one night by the groans of a fellow prisoner,
  who threw himself about in his sleep, obviously having a horrible nightmare. Since
  I had always been especially sorry for people who suffered from fearful dreams or
  deliria, I wanted to wake the poor man. Suddenly I drew back the hand which was
  ready to shake him, frightened at the thing I was about to do. At that moment I
  became intensely conscious of the fact that no dream, no matter how horrible, could
  be as bad as the reality of the camp which surrounded us, and to which I was about
  to recall him.
- Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external
  situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead
  of taking the camp's difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not
  take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred
  to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.
- 'The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a humorous light is
  some kind of a trick learned while mastering the art of living. Yet it is possible
  to practice the art of living even in a concentration camp, although suffering is
  omnipresent. To draw an analogy: a man''s suffering is similar to the behavior of
  gas. If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill
  the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering
  completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering
  is great or little. Therefore the "size" of human suffering is absolutely relative.'
- 'An active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values
  in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity
  to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also
  purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which
  admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man''s attitude
  to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. A creative life and
  a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are
  meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in
  suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without
  suffering and death human life cannot be complete.'
- The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way
  in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most
  difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave,
  dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget
  his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a
  man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values
  that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy
  of his sufferings or not.
- When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering
  as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that
  even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him
  of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way
  in which he bears his burden.
- Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have
  had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have
  brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest
  kind.
- Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension,
  the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish,
  or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent
  in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should
  not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to
  fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency.
  I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man
  needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, "homeostasis,"
  i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but
  rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.
  What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential
  meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him.
