quotes:
- He was thirty-six years old and still felt the force of exponential growth in his
  veins, of life straining to burst the vessel in which it had been contained. He
  could have it all again, with the difference that this time he would want what he
  had.
- But in a way it's like looking at old photographs of yourself. There comes a point
  at which the record needs to be updated, because you've shed too many links with
  what you were. He doesn't quite know how it happened; all he knows is that he doesn't
  recognise himself in those stories anymore, though he remembers the bursting feeling
  of writing them, something in himself massing and pushing irresistibly to be born.
  He hasn't had that feeling since; he almost thinks that to remain a writer he'd
  have to become one all over again, when he might just as easily become an astronaut,
  or a farmer.
- In his marriage, he now realised, the principle of progress was always at work,
  in the acquiring of houses, possessions, cars, the drive towards higher social status,
  more travel, a wider circle of friends, even the production of children felt like
  an obligatory calling-point on the mad journey; and it was inevitable, he now saw,
  that once there were no more things to add or improve on, no more goals to achieve
  or stages to pass through, the journey would seem to have run its course, and he
  and his wife would be beset by a great sense of futility and by the feeling of some
  malady, which was really only the feeling of stillness after a life of too much
  motion, such as sailors experience when they walk on dry land after too long at
  sea, but which to both of them signified that they were no longer in love. If only
  we had had the sense, he said, to make our peace with one another then, to start
  from the honest proposition that we were two people not in love who nonetheless
  meant one another no harm; well, he said, his eyes brimming again, if that had been
  the case I believe we might have learned truly to love one another and to love ourselves.
- What Ryan had learned from this is that your failures keep returning to you, while
  your successes are something you always have to convince yourself of.
- There was a great difference, I said, between the things I wanted and the things
  that I could apparently have, and until I had finally and forever made my peace
  with that fact, I had decided to want nothing at all.
- 'And I realised eventually, I said, that it could never be resolved, not so long
  as the aim was to establish the truth, for there was no single truth any more, that
  was the point. There was no longer a shared vision, a shared reality even. Each
  of them saw things now solely from his own perspective: there was only point of
  view.'
- There was no such thing as an unblemished childhood, though people will do everything
  they can to convince you otherwise. There was no such thing as a life without pain.
- You build a whole structure on a period of intensity that’s never repeated. It’s
  the basis of your faith and sometimes you doubt it, but you never renounce it because
  too much of your life stands on that ground.
- But the only hope of finding anything is to stay exactly where you are, at the agreed
  place. It’s just a question of how long you can hold out.
- It seems success takes you away from what you know, he said, while failure condemns
  you to it.
- "‘The parts of life that are suffocating’, Angeliki said, ‘are so often the parts
  that are the projection of our parents’ own desires."
- Perhaps, he said, we are all like animals in the zoo, and once we see that one of
  us has got out of the enclosure we shout at him to run like mad, even though it
  will only result in him becoming lost.
- 'For most of the people she knew, people in their forties, this was a time of softening
  and expanding, of expectations growing blurred, of running a little to seed or to
  fat after the exhaustion of the chase: she saw them beginning to relax and make
  themselves comfortable in their lives.'
- He began to ask me questions, as though he had learned to remind himself to do so,
  and I wondered what or who had taught him that lesson, which many people never learn.
- And likewise I was beginning to see my own fears and desires manifested outside
  myself, was beginning to see in other people’s lives a commentary on my own.
- And if there’s one thing I know it’s that writing comes out of tension, tension
  between what’s inside and what’s outside.
- 'This anti-description, for want of a better way of putting it, had made something
  clear to her by a reverse kind of exposition: while he talked she began to see herself
  as a shape, an outline, with all the detail filled in around it while the shape
  itself remained blank. Yet this shape, even while its content remained unknown,
  gave her for the first time since the incident a sense of who she now was.'
- They were both still young enough to believe that this principle of growth was exponential;
  that life was only expansive, and broke the successive vessels in which you tried
  to contain it in its need to expand more.
- 'That time spent swimming in the pool beneath the waterfall belongs nowhere: it
  is part of no sequence of events, it is only itself, in a way that nothing in our
  life before as a family was ever itself, because it was always leading to the next
  thing and the next, was always contributing to our story of who we were.'
- If only we had had the sense, he said, to make our peace with one another then,
  to start from the honest proposition that we were two people not in love who nonetheless
  meant one another no harm; well, he said, his eyes brimming again, if that had been
  the case I believe we might have learned truly to love one another and to love ourselves.
- I wasn’t sure it was possible, in marriage, to know what you actually were, or indeed
  to separate what you were from what you had become through the other person.
- I said that I thought most of us didn’t know how truly good or truly bad we were,
  and most of us would never be sufficiently tested to find out.
- "‘I would like’, she resumed, ‘to see the world more innocently again, more impersonally,
  but I have no idea how to achieve this, other than by going somewhere completely
  unknown, where I have no identity and no associations."
