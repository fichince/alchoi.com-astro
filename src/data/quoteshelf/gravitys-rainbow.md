title: Gravity's Rainbow
author: Thomas Pynchon
quotes:
- The young statistician is devoted to number and to method, not table-rapping or
  wishful thinking. But in the domain of zero to one, not-something to something,
  Pointsman can only possess the zero and the one. He cannot, like Mexico, survive
  anyplace in between.
- Solitude, even among the meshes of this war, can when it wishes so take him by the
  blind gut and touch, as now, possessively.

  “Hhahh," Pirate in a voiceless roar watching his breath slip away over the parapets, "hhaahhh!" Rooftops dance in the morning. His giant bananas cluster, radiant yellow, humid green. His companions below dream drooling of a Banana Breakfast. This well-scrubbed day ought to be no worse than any—

  Will it? Far to the east, down in the pink sky, something has just sparked, very brightly. A new star, nothing less noticeable. He leans on the parapet to watch. The brilliant point has already become a short vertical white line. It must be somewhere out over the North Sea at least that far… icefields below and a cold smear of sun…
- He has become obsessed with the idea of a rocket with his name written on it—if
  they're really set on getting him (“They" embracing possibilities far far beyond
  Nazi Germany) that's the surest way, doesn't cost them a thing to paint his name
  on every one, right?
- Yesterday happened to be a good day. They found a child, alive, a little girl, half-suffocated
  under a Morrison shelter. Waiting for the stretcher, Slothrop held her small hand,
  gone purple with the cold. Dogs barked in the street. When she opened her eyes and
  saw him her first words were, "Any gum, chum?" Trapped there for two days, gumless—all
  he had for her was a Thayer's Slippery Elm. He felt like an idiot. Before they took
  her off she brought his hand over to kiss anyway, her mouth and cheek in the flare
  lamps cold as frost, the city around them at once a big desolate icebox, stale-smelling
  and no surprises inside ever again. At which point she smiled, very faintly, and
  he knew that's what he'd been waiting for, wow, a Shirley Temple smile, as if this
  exactly canceled all they'd found her down in the middle of.
- He's wasted gallons of paint thinner striking his faithful Zippo, its charred wick,
  virility giving way to thrift, rationed down to a little stub, the blue flame sparking
  about the edges in the dark, the many kinds of dark, just to see what's happening
  with her face. Each new flame, a new face.
- 'Once Roger and Jessica might have stopped. But they''re both alumni of the Battle
  of Britain, both have been drafted into the early black mornings and the crying
  for mercy, the dumb inertia of cobbles and beams, the profound shortage of mercy
  in those days… By the time one has pulled one''s nth victim or part of a victim
  free of one''s nth pile of rubble, he told her once, angry, weary, it has ceased
  to be that personal… the value of n may be different for each of us, but I''m sorry:
  sooner or later…'
