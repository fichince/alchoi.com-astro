title: The Golden Notebook
author: Doris Lessing
quotes:
- "‘It's not that I wouldn't want to be, but I don't think I could.' Now he turned
  to his father, in patient explanation. ‘The thing about mother and Anna is this;
  one doesn't say, Anna Wulf the writer, or Molly Jacobs the actress-or only if you
  don't know them. They aren't - what I mean is- they aren't what they do; but if
  I start working with you, then I'll be what I do. Don't you see that?’"
- "‘You mean you've never felt that awful moral exhaustion, what the hell does it
  matter?'"
- And our jokes, outside the formal meetings, were contrary to what we said, and thought
  we believed in. It is from that period of my life that I know how to watch the jokes
  people make. A slightly malicious tone, a cynical edge to a voice, can have developed
  inside ten years a cancer that has destroyed a whole personality. I've seen it often,
  and in many other places than political or communist organizations.
- When the two women went out together, Anna deliberately effaced herself and played
  to the dramatic Molly. When they were alone, she tended to take the lead. But this
  had by no means been true at the beginning of their friendship. Molly, abrupt, straightforward,
  tactless, had frankly domineered Anna. Slowly, and the offices of Mother Sugar had
  had a good deal to do with it, Anna learned to stand up for herself. Even now there
  were moments when she should challenge Molly when she did not. She admitted to herself
  she was a coward; she would always give in rather than have fights or scenes. A
  quarrel would lay Anna low for days, whereas Molly thrived on them. She would burst
  into exuberant tears, say unforgivable things, and have forgotten all about it half
  a day later. Meanwhile Anna would be limply recovering in her flat.
- 'Anna, watching, thought amusedly: If I said to Molly, you stopped Richard talking
  simply by making fun of him with your hands, she wouldn''t know what I meant. How
  wonderful to be able to do that, how lucky she is…'
- The point is, that the function of the novel seems to be changing; it has become
  an outpost of journalism; we read novels for information about areas of life we
  don't know—Nigeria, South Africa, the American army, a coal-mining village, coteries
  in Chelsea, etc. We read to *find out what is going on*. One novel in five hundred
  or a thousand has the quality a novel should have to make it a novel—the quality
  of philosophy.
- From the process of writing these words about Willi I have discovered I know nothing
  about him. About someone one understands, one doesn't have to make lists of words.
