    A key theme in this history has been the mismatch between mankind's ability to understand the world and so reshape it, and on the other hand the lack of progress in how we are ruled. Science strides ahead;
    politics stumbles around like a drunk. We saw it in the age of discovery and the age of empire, but it was particularly glaring in the twentieth century--and, I would add (so far), the twenty-first too.
