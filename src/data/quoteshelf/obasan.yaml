quotes:
- To travel with confidence down this route the most reliable map I am given is the
  example of my mother's and Grandma's alert and accurate knowing. When I am hungry,
  and before I can ask, there is food. If I am weary, every place is a bed. No food
  that is distasteful must be eaten and there is neither praise nor blame for the
  body's natural functions. A need to urinate is to be heeded whether in public or
  visiting friends. A sweater covers me before there is any chill and if there is
  pain there is care simultaneously. If Grandma shifts uncomfortably, I bring her
  a cushion.
- Squatting here with the putty knife in her hand, she is every old woman in every
  hamlet in the world. You see her on a street corner in a village in southern France,
  in a black dress and black stockings. Or bent over stone steps in a Mexican mountain
  village. Everywhere the old woman stands as the true and rightful owner of the earth.
  She is the bearer of keys to unknown doorways and to a network of astonishing  tunnels.
  She is the possessor of life's infinite personal details.
- Some of the Native children I've had in my classes over the years could almost pass
  for Japanese, and vice versa. There's something in the animal-like shyness I recognize
  in the dark eyes. A quickness to look away. I remember, when I was a child in Slocan,
  seeing the same swift flick-of-a-cat's-tail look in the eyes of my friends.
- 'Personality: Tense. Is that past or present tense? It''s perpetual tense. I have
  the social graces of a common housefly. That''s self-denigrating, isn''t it?'
- '"Some people," Aunt Emily answered sharply, "are so busy seeing all sides of every
  issue that they neutralize concern and prevent necessary action. There''s no strength
  in seeing all sides unless you can act where real measurable injustice exists. A
  lot of academic talk just immobilizes the oppressed and maintains oppressors in
  their positions of power."'
