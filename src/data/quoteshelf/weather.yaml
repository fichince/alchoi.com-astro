quotes:
- Later, Sylvia tells me her end of the table was even worse. The guy in the Gore-Tex
  jacket was going on and on about transhumanism and how we would soon shed these
  burdensome bodies and become part of the singularity. "These people long for immortality
  but can't wait ten minutes for a cup of coffee," she says.
- 'In the first class I ever took with Sylvia, she told us about assortative mating.
  Meaning like with likeâ€”depressive with depressive. The problem with assortative
  mating, she said, is that it feels perfectly correct when you do it. Like a key
  fitting into a lock and opening a door. The question being: Is this really the room
  you want to spend your life in?'

  There was once a race of mythic arctic dwellers called the Hyperboreans. Their weather was mild, their trees bore fruit all year, and no one was ever sick. But after a thousand years, they grew bored of this life. They decked themselves in garlands and leaped off the cliffs into the sea.

  "What is the core delusion?" Margot asks the class, but nobody knows the right answer, and she doesn't bother to tell us.
- The dentist gave me something so I won't grind my teeth in my sleep. I consider
  putting it in, decide against it. My husband is under the covers reading a long
  book about an ancient war. He turns out the light, arranges the blankets so we'll
  stay warm. The dog twitches her paws softly against the bed. Dreams of running,
  of other animals. I wake to the sound of gunshots. Walnuts on the roof, Ben says.
  The core delusion is that I am here and you are there.
- It was the same after 9/11, there was that hum in the air. Everyone everywhere talking
  about the same thing. In stores, in restaurants, on the subway. My friend met me
  at the diner for coffee. His family fled Iran one week before the Shah fell. He
  didn't want to talk about the hum. I pressed him though. Your people have finally
  fallen into history, he said. The rest of us are already here.
