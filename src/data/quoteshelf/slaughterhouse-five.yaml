title: Slaughterhouse-Five
author: Kurt Vonnegut
quotes:
- I have told my sons that they are not under any circumstances to take part in massacres,
  and that the news of massacres of enemies is not to fill them with satisfaction
  or glee.
- Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present, and
  the future.
- There was a soft drink bottle on the windowsill. Its label boasted that it contained
  no nourishment whatsoever.
- Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make
  money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore,
  those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame
  has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their
  poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic
  times.
- On Tralfamadore, says Billy Pilgrim, there isn’t much interest in Jesus Christ.
  The Earthling figure who is most engaging to the Tralfamadorian mind, he says, is
  Charles Darwin—who taught that those who die are meant to die, that corpses are
  improvements. So it goes.
