quotes:
- I had never heard Buddy so upset. He was very proud of his perfect health and was
  always telling me it was psychosomatic when my sinuses blocked up and I couldn't
  breathe. I thought this an odd attitude for a doctor to have and perhaps he should
  study to be a psychiatrist instead, but of course I never came right out and said
  so.

  […] I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.

  After that—in spite of the Girl Scouts and the piano lessons and the water-colour lessons and the dancing lessons and the sailing camp, all of which my mother scrimped to give me, and college, with crewing in the mist before breakfast and black-bottom pies and the little new firecrackers of ideas going every day—I had never been really happy again.
- I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig-tree, starving to death, just because
  I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every
  one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable
  to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped
  to the ground at my feet.

  I liked looking on at other people in crucial situations. If there was a road accident or a street fight or a baby pickled in a laboratory jar for me to look at, I'd stop and look so hard I never forgot it.

  I certainly learned a lot of things I never would have learned otherwise this way, and even when they surprised me or made me sick I never let on, but pretended that's the way I knew things were all the time.

  There is something demoralizing about watching two people get more and more crazy about each other, especially when you are the only extra person in the room.

  It's like watching Paris from an express caboose heading in the opposite direction—every second the city gets smaller and smaller, only you feel it's really you getting smaller and smaller and lonelier and lonelier, rushing away from all those lights and that excitement at about a million miles an hour.
- The silence depressed me. It wasn't the silence of silence. It was my own silence.

  The reason I hadn't washed my clothes or my hair was because it seemed so silly.

  I saw the days of the year stretching ahead like a series of bright, white boxes, and separating one box from another was sleep, like a black shade. Only for me, the long perspective of shades that set off one box from the next had suddenly snapped up, and I could see day after day after day glaring ahead of me like a white, broad, infinitely desolate avenue.

  It seemed silly to wash one day when I would only have to wash again the next.

  It made me tired just to think of it.

  I wanted to do everything once and for all and be through with it.
- And I knew that in spite of all the roses and kisses and restaurant dinners a man
  showered on a woman before he married her, what he secretly wanted when the wedding
  service ended was for her to flatten out underneath his feet like Mrs Willard's
  kitchen mat.

  It might be nice to be pure and then to marry a pure man, but what if he suddenly confessed he wasn't pure after we were married, the way Buddy Willard had? I couldn't stand the idea of a woman having to have a single pure life and a man being able to have a double life, one pure and one not.

  Finally I decided that if it was so difficult to find a red-blooded intelligent man who was still pure by the time he was twenty-one I might as well forget about staying pure myself and marry somebody who wasn't pure either. Then when he started to make my life miserable I could make his miserable as well.
- I knew I should be grateful to Mrs Guinea, only I couldn't feel a thing. If Mrs
  Guinea had given me a ticket to Europe, or a round-the-world cruise, it wouldn't
  have made one scrap of difference to me, because wherever I sat—on the deck of a
  ship or at a street café in Paris or Bangkok—I would be sitting under the same glass
  bell jar, stewing in my own sour air.
- A fresh fall of snow blanketed the asylum grounds—not a Christmas sprinkle, but
  a man-high January deluge, the sort that snuffs out schools and offices and churches,
  and leaves, for a day or more, a pure, blank sheet in place of memo pads, date books
  and calendars.

  We'll take up where we left off, Esther,' she had said, with her sweet, martyr's smile. 'We'll act as if all this were a bad dream.'

  A bad dream.

  To the person in the bell jar, blank and stopped as a dead baby, the world itself is the bad dream.

  A bad dream.

  I remembered everything.
