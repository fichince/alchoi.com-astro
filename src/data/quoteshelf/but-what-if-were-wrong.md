title: But What If We're Wrong?
author: Chuck Klosterman
quotes:
- We live in an age where virtually no content is lost and virtually all content is
  shared. The sheer amount of information about every current idea makes those concepts
  difficult to contradict, particularly in a framework where public consensus has
  become the ultimate arbiter of validity. In other words, we’re starting to behave
  as if we’ve reached the end of human knowledge. And while that notion is undoubtedly
  false, the sensation of certitude it generates is paralyzing
- 'We constantly pretend our perception of the present day will not seem ludicrous
  in retrospect, simply because there doesn’t appear to be any other option. Yet there
  is another option, and the option is this: We must start from the premise that—in
  all likelihood—we are already wrong. And not “wrong” in the sense that we are examining
  questions and coming to incorrect conclusions, because most of our conclusions are
  reasoned and coherent. The problem is with the questions themselves.'
