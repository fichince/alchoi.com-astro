title: Coding projects

My love of code started in grade school when my parents enrolled me in an extracurricular math program. Along with the weekly homework and quizzes, we students sometimes got small programming assignments, to be completed on the desktop computers set up on the side of the classroom. We wrote simple functions in QBasic to solve math problems, and it was then that I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up.

I’ve since had a long career in software development, and the latest step in my journey finds me working independently as a freelancer. Below, you’ll find some links and screenshots of projects that I’ve been involved in.
