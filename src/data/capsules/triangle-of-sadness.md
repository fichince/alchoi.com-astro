Does anyone really think that profiting off landmines and hand grenades is _not_ immoral? Because the anti-capitalist messaging in _Triangle of Sadness_ can be so unsubtle, it had a “preaching to the choir” vibe for me. But I enjoyed the comedic absurdity that permeates the film, especially the gross-out “Captain’s Dinner” scene. Special shout-out to [Charlbi Dean][1]’s magnetic performance. RIP.
