This comedic documentary just wrapped up its third and final season. It's worth catching up with it for its truly unique format: the entire thing is made from first-person footage of random things happening in New York City, with intentionally awkward narration by Wilson. Every episode ostensibly has an educational topic, e.g. "How To Clean Your Ears", but it inevitably veers off on some unexpected tangent. It's not a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy, at least not for me, but I was always charmed by his worldview. It's also suspenseful in a way because we don't know what type of odd real-life characters he'll meet next.
