Emma Stone is iconic in this: bizarre costumes, spastic dancing, robotic walking, and especially dialogue. I love it when language is written in an off-kilter but still understandable way (see [George Saunders](https://georgesaundersbooks.com/), [_Milkman_](/quick-reviews/milkman)), and Stone’s delivery of her lines is delightful, especially when speaking bluntly about sexual matters. Which, by the way, maybe there are too many sex scenes… I don’t mean that in a prudish way, just that it gets a bit repetitive after a while.
