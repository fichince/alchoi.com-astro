After being [blown away by _The First Omen_](/blog/2024-10-28-halloween-binge), I just had to go back and check out the original film that launched the franchise. I guess it’s considered a horror classic, but I had never seen it before.

Surprisingly, the movie made me laugh a lot. I mean no disrespect; I would characterize it more as “laughing _with_” than “laughing _at_,” even though I’m sure the filmmakers didn’t intend to produce a comedy. I laughed because I was charmed… movies have evolved since the 70’s, and the rhythms and beats that were used to create suspense back then now seem over-the-top. Compared to horror movies today, everything—the acting, editing, sound—feels slower, but _bigger_, more theatrical. Especially notable was the score, which was not subtle at all, transitioning from idyllic melodies into _Psycho_-esque [stings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_dun_duuun!) at the drop of a hat.

Again, that’s not to say that I didn’t like it. I enjoyed the ride. With older films, since they didn’t have the ability to cram special effects into every other scene, the handful of _wow_ moments really stand out. I also got a kick out of learning the context of the references in _The First Omen_. I look forward to a future double feature, watching the two back-to-back.
