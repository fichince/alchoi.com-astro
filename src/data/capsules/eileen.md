For the first half of this movie, I couldn't help comparing it to [_Carol_](https://letterboxd.com/film/carol-2015/). They share the dynamic of a young, shy woman being attracted to an older, more glamourous and confident woman. But for me, _Eileen_ felt like a lesser version; its dialogue is somewhat shallow and obvious, lacking in mystery.

It turns out that the film is more of a thriller than it sets itself up as. I won't spoil it, but it goes to an intense and uncomfortable place. While it succeeds in setting the movie apart, I didn't feel like there was much depth to the story overall.
