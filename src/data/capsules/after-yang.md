This film has a fascinating and unique premise: a family who has adopted a Chinese girl purchases an android with the same ethnicity—a _cultural techno-sapien_, as they call it—to act as her older brother, and to ensure that she has a connection to her heritage. But he malfunctions, and in the process of trying to repair him[^1], they gain access to his storage modules and are able to view his memories.

Due to the title, I don’t think it’s a spoiler to say that their efforts are unsuccessful, and the film becomes an emotional meditation on grief. When we lose someone close to us, we usually focus on our memories of them. This film uses the sci-fi premise to invert that idea and ask, what would the departed hold as _their_ most treasured memories of _us_?
