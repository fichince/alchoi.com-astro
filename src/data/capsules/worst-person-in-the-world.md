I enjoyed watching this Norwegian drama, and was moved to see how a romantic relationship can evolve and still have meaning even after it ends. One standout scene is when the main character Julie crashes a party and meets Eivind, and the two flirt in escalating ways while making sure that they don't cross the line into cheating on their respective partners.

In hindsight though, I found Julie to be empty as a character (through no fault of Renate Reinsve's charismatic performance). I get that she's meant to be indecisive, and doesn't know what she wants, but that idea could have been explored. She only doesn't know what she wants given the limited set of choices that modern society presents her; but I believe that everybody wants _something_... it's the spaces _between_ the choices that make a person. Case in point, the Aksel character--who seems to be a surrogate for the writer/director, since he's all about making art--gets plenty of introspective moments. Why not give these moments to the main character?
