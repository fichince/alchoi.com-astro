A non-narrative documentary in the vein of [_Koyaanisqatsi_](https://letterboxd.com/film/koyaanisqatsi/) and [_Baraka_](https://letterboxd.com/film/baraka/). _Ascension_ doesn't quite reach those heights; what's missing for me is the [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMV850rhcQM), which is key for "vibes" films like these.

I appreciated the film's look at China's working class. For the most part, the goal that these people are trying to ascend towards--wealth--remains an invisible spectre that hangs over them. You don't see the bosses that they're trying to please by taking smiling lessons; you don't see the VIPs that they're training as bodyguards to protect; you don't see who they're constructing the sex dolls for.

I almost wish that the film that kept that limited perspective for the entire runtime, but we do see a fancy dinner with those who have ascended all the way to the top. But for them, there is a higher goal: they seem preoccupied with the Western influences of the table settings and glassware. Is the Chinese Dream really worth chasing if it just leads you into the same materialistic folly as the American Dream?
