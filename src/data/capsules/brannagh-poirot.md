Is this a trilogy or are they making more of these?

I didn't expect to like these much, as their reputation is not great, but I had a good time. I've not read much Agatha Christie, but she's legendary for a reason. I think the source material is strong enough to save these movies from their filmmaking flaws.

People seem to dunk on _Death on the Nile_ in particular, but it was actually my favourite. The character relationships have real emotional weight, especially because one of the victims is personally connected to Poirot.

_Murder on the Orient Express_, on the other hand, has too many characters to connect together. It probably works way better in book form. But what a stacked cast!

_A Haunting in Venice_ is effectively creepy. It seems that Brannagh was trying to be creative with all the wide-angle lenses and weird camera angles. I say, go for it, Kenny! It worked for _Thor_, remember that?
