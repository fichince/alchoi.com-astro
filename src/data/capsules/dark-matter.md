This show caught my attention because I have fond memories of a road trip with my wife, during which we listened to an audiobook of [_Recursion_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bbc4a8fd-d198-4656-a800-ab3cdf140ad0), by the same author, Blake Crouch. The common thread between these two stories, and what I suppose is the strength of the author, is a mind-bending, twisty sci-fi plot, featuring a character who is motivated by a specific kind of romantic love, that of loyal, long-term partners. It’s this latter emotional element that makes me a fan of his work.[^1]

It’s an unfortunate consequence of marketing that one usually knows a bit about the premise of a show before watching it. As a result, the first few episodes of _Dark Matter_ feel a little slow, because we already know the basic explanation for what’s going on. I think it would be cool to dive in completely fresh.

Having said that, I need to reveal some _**spoilers ahead**_ to discuss what I enjoyed about the show.

During the middle episodes, as the protagonist Jason explores the many worlds of the multiverse, the question comes up: knowing that there are infinite variations of every person, where each one made different decisions in their lives, what defines the core of a person? By the end, as those infinite variations of Jason appear in the “home” world, the show answers the question in a fascinating, tragic way: he’s defined by his desire to be with his family, and the one copy that we’re rooting for just happens to have been the one that we’ve been following. They all have equal right to their happy ending, but they won’t be able to get it.
