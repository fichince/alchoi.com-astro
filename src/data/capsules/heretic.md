I had a good time with this horror thriller, especially for the first two-thirds. The performances from the trio of lead actors are all impressive, and the characters’ respective stances on religion are all well-represented. On the downside, the villain’s plot suffers from being overly convoluted—it’s a long walk just to make a philosophical point.

There’s a point that I want to think through, which will require spoilers, so stop reading if you don’t want to know.

<!-- excerpt -->

Near the beginning of the movie, Sister Paxton says that she wishes to come back as a butterfly when she dies, so that she can visit her loved ones. I immediately wondered whether reincarnation was part of the Mormon belief system (it isn’t), and I assumed Mr. Reed would call her out on it, as part of his attack on religion—he would say: if her beliefs don’t even line up with the dogma of her church, how can she call herself a representative of her faith? But he doesn’t bring it up, and later, it becomes a poignant emotional moment at the end, when she sees a butterfly after her partner, Sister Barnes, is killed.

For a movie that’s so concerned with a rigorous debate about religion, I don’t think that the writers would have made this oversight. So I choose to conclude that Sister Paxton’s heretical belief in reincarnation is an intentional statement about how people engage with their faiths.

Regrettably, there was a time in my life where I would have picked on any inconsistency in a person’s faith, and used it as “proof” that religion is illogical and therefore invalid. But I’ve learned over the years that religions aren’t monoliths: their followers can accept and reject parts of their teachings, and that’s okay. Whatever people believe in, it’s just a part of their complex whole being, and acceptance should be the default position for everyone, whether or not they’re religious.
