In my opinion, this movie spends most of its runtime on the least interesting part of the story. What fascinated me was the scientific and technological developments in creating the bomb. On multiple occasions, supporting characters say how important and brilliant Oppie is, but the film doesn’t let him demonstrate it. Instead, it’s more concerned with the question of whether he is a Communist. On a script level, I respect the interweaving timelines, framed through hearings and interrogations, because I know it’s difficult to pull off. But I kind of wish the movie had been less complex, and more deliberately paced, so that we could a) see the science happen, and b) sit with the moral questions that it raises.

P.S. I think that [_The Social Network_][1] is the superior “flashbacks via hearings” movie.
