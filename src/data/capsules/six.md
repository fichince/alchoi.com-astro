To best enjoy this musical about [the six wives of King Henry VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wives_of_Henry_VIII), it's good to brush up on the history. The lyrics contain a lot of jokes and references that I wouldn't have gotten had I not learned a bit about the real-life stories.[^1]

The songs are catchy, though unexceptional. The best song for me is [the one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao1F_8BoMlk) for [Catherine Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Howard). Through several repetitions of the chorus, she comes to realize that men objectify her, and goes through an emotional journey from playful to tragic. The singer ends the song with a sob, a surely challenging feat for an actor.
