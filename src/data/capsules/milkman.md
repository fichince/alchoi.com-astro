In terms of [subject matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles), _Milkman_ is like the song ["Zombie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ejga4kJUts) in book form. There are bombs and bombs and guns. But where the Cranberries' song is filled with anger, Anna Burns uses a more delicate touch.

The unnamed protagonist is a young woman who is being pestered "the milkman," who is romantically interested in her and also happens to be a member of a paramilitary organization. The stalking alone makes for anxious reading, but the real tragedy is that she has nobody to turn to. Because they live in basically a warzone, the entire community is in a constant state of mistrust and paranoia, and her personal struggles are only seen in the context of which side of the political conflict she may or may not be on.

Despite the dark story, the writing style is quirky and playful, in a way that reminds of a bit of [George Saunders](/quick-reviews/swim-in-a-pond). There's a lot of absurdist humour, like how the parents of the protaganist's "maybe-boyfriend" have abandoned their family to become internationally famous ballroom dancers. I enjoyed this read, even if it does feel little bit repetitive and long-winded at times.
