Entertaining to watch, and gives you reason to root for a group of young activists, even if their actions undoubtedly lie in a moral grey area. In the end, though, the web of their backstories feels more like a point-form enumeration through the harms of corporate-backed climate change, rather than the lives of fully realized characters. 

Your mileage may vary with the retro aesthetic. Personally, I donâ€™t love the gritty 16mm look.
