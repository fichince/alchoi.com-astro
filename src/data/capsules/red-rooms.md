To paraphrase an [old wise man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PzdN3Q5lac)… who’s the more psychopathic: the serial killer, or the fan who’s obsessed with him?

The film follows the trial of a man charged with killing multiple victims and recording the murders to post on “_le dark web_.” In the viewing gallery are a couple of young women who are “fans” of the killer.

I admit my attention wavered a bit during the first half, because the main character is so mysterious that there’s nothing to connect with. But I really enjoyed how the movie escalates once she starts taking action. Her motivations are still unclear, but it’s fun to try to figure her out.
