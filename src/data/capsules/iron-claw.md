Biopics work best for me when I know nothing about their subject. Such was the case for _The Iron Claw_, which tells the story of the [Von Erich family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Erich_family) of pro wrestlers. The film is well-directed and well-acted, and I was sucked into wanting to know what happens next. The amount of tragedy that the family endured is almost unbelievable. However, I have to say that it left little emotional impact on me. I should have been bawling throughout the film, but I wasn't.
