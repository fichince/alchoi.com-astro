Things that are spirals in _Uzumaki_ (lit. "Spiral"): dust devils, tongues, snails, water draining from bathtub, smoke, people who have turned into snails, people in general, hair, a hurricane, growths from a skin condition, staircases, etc.

This horror manga series was not the most narratively satisfying, but works great as a creative exploration of the visual motif of a spiral. So much in nature takes the form of spirals, so there's nothing inherently scary about the shape, but when it invades and twists human bodies, the result is effectively stomach-churning.
