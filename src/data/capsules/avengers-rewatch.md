I got some disappointing personal news just before Christmas which, paired with the free time that the holidays bring, meant that I was looking for some cinematic comfort food to pass the days. The MCU has been pretty weak since the end of "Phase 3"[^1], and I had not revisited these last two _Avengers_ entries since _Endgame_ came out in 2019.

I was just as impressed as I was when I first saw them: it's like watching the finale of a long-running TV series. _Endgame_ especially rewards the loyal viewer with bittersweet character moments.

File these away to revisit again every few years...
