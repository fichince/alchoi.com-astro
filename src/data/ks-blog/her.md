I was reminded of this movie when [news broke](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her) about Scarlett Johansson’s dispute with OpenAI for using her vocal likeness without permission.

I recall being underwhelmed by my first viewing when it first came out. Back then, I thought it was a simply a riff on the rom-com formula, which swaps one of the couple with an artificial intelligence[^1]. In hindsight, I understand my lukewarm reaction as coming from my lack of relationship experience. At the time, any romance that I saw on screen, even between human characters, felt artificial to me because they were only characters, and I couldn’t see myself in them. The fact that one of the characters was a computer program didn’t make it any more artificial.

But now that I’m happily married, movies like _Her_ work much better for me, because _of course_ there’s a difference between connecting with a human and conversing with your phone. _Of course_ the protagonist would be attracted to a personality that molded itself to his needs, after losing a marriage to someone he loved but didn’t love him back.

[^1]: In the film’s dialogue, they use the term “OS”—e.g. “My girlfriend is an OS”—which isn’t exactly technically correct 🤓
