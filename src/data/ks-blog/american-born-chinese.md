If you've got both Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan in the cast, I'm going to watch it.

Yeoh gets some cool fight scenes as the Goddess Guanyin, and the action choreography in general is pretty good in this show, which transplants the mythology of [_Journey to the West_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West) into a high school setting.

Quan's role as a former TV sitcom star is a bit odd... his character is completely unrelated to the plot, and he never meets any of the main characters. It serves only as a commentary on Asian representation in media, which is an important message, but quite distracting because of how disconnected it is.
