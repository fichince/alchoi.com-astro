I was a fan of the TV show _The Good Place_, and this book dives deeper into the philosophical concepts behind that show's exploration of morality. The subject matter is pretty dry and basic (I was familiar with much of it from taking a 100-level philosophy course in university), but the author, who also created and ran the TV show, imbues his sitcom-honed sense of humour into it. A bonus if you’re listening to the audiobook: the _Good Place_ cast comes along for the ride; a highlight is Ted Danson’s dramatic reading of chapter titles.
