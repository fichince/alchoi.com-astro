My main takeaway from this book is to try to see social issues in terms of _insecurity_ instead of _inequality_. It's easy to blame inequality on greedy wealthy people, which amplifies the divisions between people, whereas insecurity is a function of the capitalist system, and affects everyone. The reason that greed is such a powerful force is because everyone is afraid is losing it all, no matter how much they have.

I'm not sure if the book really sticks to this idea, though. We get the historical background of the origins of capitalism, which is a story about barons and commoners, which brings us back around the division between haves and have-nots all over again.

While I appreciated the historical and especially the Canadian context in this book, it felt overall like preaching to the choir. (I'm already quite the socialist.) It's also written in a somewhat academic style, which made it increasingly skimmable towards the end.
