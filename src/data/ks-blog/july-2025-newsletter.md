Hi!

My experiment with 1 Second Everyday continues, but I must admit I’m running out of steam a little bit. There are days where I feel like nothing noteworthy happens, and I end up taking _yet another_ video of the trees or the sky or something boring. But, at the end of the month, when I go back and review the compiled video, it doesn’t feel boring at all. I guess that’s the whole point of the exercise: it shows you that there’s always something interesting happening, and you just need to look for it.

I combined the videos for May and June, which you can view [here](https://youtu.be/yoSp0gUxsos).

## A new project

I’m happy to announce that I’ve joined the development team at [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app), a website and app for book lovers to track their reading and interact with each other. If you know me, you know that I’m a huge bookworm, and that I like to have [a record of everything I read](https://hardcover.app/@fi_chince), so Hardcover is right in my wheelhouse. If you’ve ever used Goodreads, it’s a similar concept, but we’re trying to do it better. Think of us as David to the Goliath of Goodreads/Amazon.

Hardcover started with a tiny team, and I’m joining [along with a cohort of ~20 others](https://hardcover.app/blog/hardcover-report-for-july-2025). The founders’ ultimate goal is for the project to become open source. It’s still early days, and unsurprisingly, feels a bit chaotic as we learn how to collaborate. But I’m having fun with learning the codebase so far, and since my work for the past few years has primarily been a solo endeavour, it’s also been nice to become a part of a team again.

## From the blog

There’s an app called [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) which lets you save articles from the web and read them later. I used it quite heavily and was upset to learn that it will be shutting down. I wrote a [post](/blog/2025/06/rip-pocket) geeking out about my search for an alternative… go check it out if you’re interested!
