Apple TV+ continues to be the place for solid shows that don’t seem to get much attention[^drops-of-god-1]. _Drops of God_ follows the two potential heirs of a deceased wine magnate’s estate—one, his estranged daughter; the other, his favourite protégé—as they compete in a series of wine-based challenges. Whoever wins will inherit a fortune, which fortune takes the form of an extensive wine collection. The premise sounds crazy, and it didn’t surprise me to learn that the story is adapted from a manga. The comic-booky feeling is even more pronounced when we realize that these people have a preternatural ability to identify the component flavours of wine just by smelling it, and that they must train to perfect their “powers” before the big “battle.” But throughout it all, the show has the gloss and high production value of a prestige drama. Attaching a serious tone to a hokey premise doesn’t usually work for me[^drops-of-god-2], but it does here!
