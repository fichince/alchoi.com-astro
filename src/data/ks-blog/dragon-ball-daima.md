The [_Dragon Ball_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball) franchise will always have a place in my heart. When [_DBZ_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dragon_Ball_Z) was airing on YTV during my high school days, I watched it religiously everyday. I’ll always regret not being able to finish the series because I moved to university and no longer had access to my own TV. More recently, I caught up with [_Dragon Ball Super_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super) during the pandemic lockdown. It didn’t leave much of an impression, to be honest, but I think I needed some comfort viewing during those anxious times.

And now, there’s a new series called [_Daima_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Daima). Unlike the previous shows, which went on forever (some would say, dragged on forever), this one is a limited series with only 20 episodes. In the show, Goku and friends are transformed into children, and must adventure through the “demon realm” to restore their normal bodies and defeat the demon king.

I don’t really have much to say about it… it’s mostly mindless action. It seems that the animation quality is more consistent than I remember of the other shows, probably because it’s a limited run. I’m not a huge fan of having the characters be children, though… it feels like a way to increase the cuteness quotient of the whole thing, but doesn’t serve any story purpose.

Anyway, I’ll always get a kick out of it whenever one of our heroes powers up and shows off a new fighting technique or a transformation. A silly but fun nostalgia trip.
