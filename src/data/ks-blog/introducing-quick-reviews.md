I’m introducing a new type of blog post under the label of [quick reviews][1]. My goal is to write down brief thoughts about the media that I consume, short enough that the entire contents of each post can appear on the main blog page. Keeping it short incentivizes me to do it more often, because I don’t have the pressure to write a lot.

The contents are what I would post on my [Storygraph][2] and [Letterboxd][3] profiles, but as I become increasingly disillusioned against the world of tech capitalism, I’m trying to own my data as much as I can. I’ll still use those platforms, but I want my words to belong to me and not live on someone else’s servers.
