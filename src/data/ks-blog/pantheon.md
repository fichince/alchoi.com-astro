[_Pantheon_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_%28TV_series%29) covers a lot of cool sci-fi concepts, the main one being the idea of “Uploaded Intelligence,” i.e. the ability to scan a person’s brain and have them live as a piece of software in the cloud. The conceit is fertile ground for exploring ideas like, what makes a person a person, and what makes this person _this specific_ person? On paper, it’s right up my alley, but I didn’t enjoy the show as much as I expected to.

I think I had trouble connecting with the characters because the animation and voice acting felt a bit flat. The story deals with a lot of heavy emotions, like grief for a departed loved one, and the choice of whether to accept the Uploaded version of that loved one as the same person. But those feelings didn’t come through for me because the animation just didn’t have the same expressiveness as, say, [_Arcane_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_%28TV_series%29), or anything from [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli).

On the positive side, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch. The various Uploaded characters often “fight” each other in the virtual world. Technically, there shouldn’t be anything to look at, as it’s essentially pieces of software trying to hack into each other’s networks, but the creators of the show chose to visualize it as if the Uploads were superheroes. They fly around and use “powers” against each other… sometimes it feels almost like a [_Dragon Ball_](/blog/2025/03/dragon-ball-daima) fight.
