I rewatched these for the first time in a while because _Dial of Destiny_ is in the cultural conversation, and my wife had not seen the originals before. You know what? I know this is a beloved character and series, but I have to say… not really my thing. Of the three[^1], I like _The Last Crusade_ the most. The Connery-Ford comedic chemistry goes a long way, and the final series of “puzzles” is genuinely cool.

Other than that, there’s a lack of character development—his only trait is that he’s always brave—and I found it annoying that his romantic relationships are all based on bickering and hostility.
