Sadly, this movie only impressed me on the superficial and technical level: the [Carpathian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains) scenery is gorgeous, and the practical special effects for bringing the ochi creatures to life are great. I don’t think A24 is big on merchandising[^ochi-1], but the toys would fly off the shelves.

Unfortunately, I had a hard time staying engaged because I found the story to be really thin. The main (human) character, Yuri, decides to help the baby ochi, in spite of her father’s hatred of them… but why? Her father later comes around, and supports her quest to return the baby to its family… but, again, why? The movie doesn’t really offer many answers beyond _Well, look at the cute little guy!_, and because of that, it feels quite empty.
