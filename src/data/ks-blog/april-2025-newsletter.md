description: (At least) one second everyday
---
I have again procrastinated… it’s been a while since I’ve sent one of these. I thought I would try a new format, which may be conducive to my doing this more regularly…

## 1 Second Everyday

So there’s this app called [1 Second Everyday](https://1se.co/), which lets you edit videos that you take daily into a series of short clips, ending up with a kind of fast-forwarded compilation of memories. It’s been around for a while, originating from a viral [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day) given by its creator.

I made the mistake of trying it for the first time in 2020. Obviously, the pandemic lockdown took away the opportunity to spend time out in the world, and I gave up because I got tired of taking videos of the same things every day. For some reason, the idea popped into my head again recently, so I decided to give it another shot.

The name of the app is kind of a misnomer. While you can make a video that is strictly only 1 second per day, I find the result way too fast and choppy. I prefer doing 2-3 seond clips, usually with more than one a day.

Here’s my finished video from the month of March 2025.
