Hello!

In my [last newsletter](/blog/2025/04/april-2025-newsletter), I shared my [first 1 Second Everyday video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XopbiTvvdtw). It’s been a fun creative experiment, which continued through the month of April. I’m definitely finding it more difficult to capture clips of “new” things… I don’t lead a wildly adventurous life, and I like my routines. Even so, I like the challenge of composing shots and trying to see familiar things from new and interesting angles.

You may notice that my dog appears frequently this month. She’s had some medical issues, which led to a lot of stress and worry for us. There were a few days, waiting for the results of lab tests, where we weren’t sure what was wrong, and the uncertainty hung over us, making it difficult to concentrate on anything else. Thankfully, she’s doing better now, and we know how to proceed with treatment.

I’ll keep this one short and end it here. I’ll be back next month!
