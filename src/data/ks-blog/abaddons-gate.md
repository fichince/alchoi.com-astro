[Me, after first book](/blog/2023/06/leviathan-wakes): The two POV characters are too similar, just a couple of dudey dudes.

Second book: More POV characters, some of them women. But they still all kind of act like dudey dudes.

[Me, after second book](/blog/2023/08/calibans-war): Better, but a bit short on ideas and thematic resonance.

Third book: Here's a new character! A pastor, whose job it is to talk about the philosophical implications of discovering alien life. But she ends up saving the day in a drug-addled action scene.

I preferred the second book to this one. The attempts to bring more philosophical discussion into the mix felt underdeveloped, in favour of a final action sequence that lasts way too long, in my opinion.

Still, onto the next!
