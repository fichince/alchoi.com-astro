[I started last year](/blog/2024/01/humankind) with an optimistic non-fiction read, and coincidentally, I recently finished another book with a similar tone, in Hannah Ritchie’s _Not the End of the World_. It feels right to start the year in a hopeful mood, so maybe this will become a quasi-New Year’s Resolution for me going forward.

Ritchie’s book uses a data-driven approach to examine the threats of climate change. She’s the lead researcher for the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and as summarized by one of the articles published there, the book asks us to hold three truths at the same time: [“The world is much better; the world is still awful; the world can do much better.”](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) It’s easy to get gloomy and focus on the latter two parts of that statement, but this book tries to shine a light on the first, and I appreciated the boost of optimism that it gave me.

Part of Ritchie’s goal is to “sort” the issues by the impact that they have, in a quantitative way. Environmentally conscious people like myself tend to worry about many different things, and feel guilty about every action that may harm the planet. But if you look at the data, some things matter more than others.

For example, [palm oil](https://ourworldindata.org/palm-oil) and [plastic packaging](https://ourworldindata.org/faq-on-plastics#are-plastic-alternatives-better-for-the-environment) get a bad rap, but their impact is small, and the alternatives may actually be more harmful. (Other oil crops require more land to grow; and _not_ packaging food would lead to more waste.) Conversely, the most impactful actions include: reducing beef and dairy consumption, driving an electric car (or driving less altogether), and of course, transitioning off the burning of fossil fuels for energy.

Ritchie sums up her ideas in a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3VVrggKz4) of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNQFqUwCnU) online. Definitely bookmark-worthy, and if I’m ever in a hopeless mood, she will serve as a reminder that there is positive change happening, and a path forward.
