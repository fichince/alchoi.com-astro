I’ve [mentioned before](/blog/2024/02/anatomy-of-a-fall) my pet peeve about stories that feature writers. I think I should qualify that a little by saying that _if the story isn’t about writing_, then the characters don’t need to be writers. _You Hurt My Feelings_ gets an exemption because it’s all about the anxieties and insecurities that afflict artistic people.

I barely consider myself to be a writer, but I could relate to the protagonist, who accidentally eavesdrops on her husband telling his friend that he didn’t like her latest book. I can imagine taking this revelation as hard as she does, if my entire identity was founded on my creative work.  Luckily, I have other skills around which to build my sense of self-worth.

The humour in the film leans more towards the cringe comedy style, which I know doesn’t work for everyone. At the end of our viewing, my wife said, “I thought it was supposed to be funny,” apparently not noticing that I had been laughing through the whole thing.
