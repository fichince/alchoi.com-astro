_Humankind_ by Rutger Bregman is a book that attempts to overturn the prevailing view that people are inherently selfish and malevolent. From the oft-referenced stories of the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) and [Kitty Genovese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese), to the everyday news, we hear a lot about the sins of humankind. Bregman dismantles these stories, arguing that they only preserve existing power and economic structures. Instead, he aims to show that we’re motivated by kindness towards others.

The book is a breezy read, filled with snappy anecdotes and factoids. It worked on me: at the beginning, I read with skepticism, trying to poke holes in his arguments; but by the end, I found everything he was saying to be obvious. Run a school without classes and lesson plans, because the students will naturally find their own path to learning? Of course! Run a prison without cells, and where the guards play games and sing songs with the inmates? Sounds like a great idea! 

It was as if the book had created a new intuition in me: take everything that is considered conventional in modern society, and _do the opposite._
