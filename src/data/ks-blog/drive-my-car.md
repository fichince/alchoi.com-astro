I watched this movie before TIFF, and then I got busy with my “coverage” of the festival, followed by a vacation. But the film left enough of an impression on me that I wanted to circle back and write down a few thoughts.

I opted to watch this rather lengthy movie one hour at a time, over three consecutive days. It’s an unfortunate fact of life that it’s rare for me to be able to spend 3 uninterrupted hours doing any one thing.

As it happens, _Drive My Car_ works really well as a kind of miniseries with roughly one-hour episodes. The film’s pace is definitely slow, with plenty of quiet passages where characters travel in—you guessed it, a car—but it didn’t test my patience, partly because I was coming to it fresh every day. There’s also a clear three act structure to the story, which lines up nicely at the hour marks.

The protagonist, Kafuku, is a stage actor and director, who is grieving the loss of his wife. His feelings are complicated, as he is aware that she was having a secret affair with another man. In an ironic turn, Kafuku heals partly by meeting and “befriending” the man who cuckolded him (although “be-frenemy-ing” might be a better term for it). In their tense conversations, the two men never explicitly mention the affair, but they both know that they both know.

<!-- excerpt -->

Kafuku also heals by bonding with his driver, a young woman who, like him, is numbed by past tragedies. At a key moment, they decide to take a road trip, covering almost the entire length of Japan. Personally, I love driving, and I found myself envying her job as a personal driver. And if I happen to make a therapeutic breakthrough and self-actualize during an epic cross-country drive, that would be an added bonus.

Side note: I followed up my viewing of the film by reading the Haruki Murakami [short story](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e2212813-ac5a-4c8c-9936-7a1710a3b2c1) from which it’s adapted. I’ve bounced off Murakami in the past because I don’t enjoy his portrayals of women, and the pattern continues here. Check this out for an opening line:

> Based on the many times he had ridden in cars driven by women, Kafuku had reached the conclusion that most female drivers fell into one of two categories: either they were a little too aggressive or a little too timid.

It’s to the movie’s credit that this kind of broad stereotyping is omitted.
