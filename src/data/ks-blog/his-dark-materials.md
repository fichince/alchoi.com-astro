I read the [trilogy of books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ea810e70-f3f9-4b46-9c3a-5a3fadf7af97)[^1] around the time that this show premiered, in 2019. I think I had always been curious about the series, and figured that I would read it before jumping into the show. I ended up being [disappointed](/blog/2025/01/storygraph-reviews) at how the story progressed, so I didn’t feel the need to follow the show as it aired.

On my recent trip to London, I saw an exhibit at the [Victoria & Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) with some [costumes](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1779672/costume-for-ruth-wilson-as-costume-mccall-caroline/) and [props](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1779677/the-alethiometer-property-collins-joel/) from the show, which reignited my interest. Even if I wasn’t fully satisfied by the books, I still enjoyed a lot of it.

The TV adaptation is so faithful that my reaction to the show pretty much mirrors how I felt about the books. The first season is the best, with a great sense of adventure and world-building, but it becomes overly convoluted by the third, final season. However, even as I lost track of the plot and character motivations, the visual depictions of fantastical beings like angels and witches and armoured bears were still pretty cool. And I like the cast, especially Dafne Keen as Lyra and Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Coulter.

All in all, I would still recommend the show if you want to see some cool magical concepts and special effects, as long as you’re prepared to be confused and frustrated by the end.

[^1]: I got my hands on a copy of an omnibus version, which has the entire trilogy in one volume. I’ve always had a thing for this idea, of having multiple books in one. Don’t ask me why…
