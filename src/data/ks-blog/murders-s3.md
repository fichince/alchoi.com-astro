I enjoyed this season less than the first two. The strength of the show was always the chemistry between the main trio, and this season attempted to change up the formula by having them “split up” temporarily. It might have worked had they individually been given compelling storylines, but I think the show fell in love with the Broadway scene too much. Personally, I wasn’t very interested in the behind-the-scenes world of musicals, even if the musical itself--a murder mystery where the suspects are babies, called _Death Rattle Dazzle!_--is a pretty funny concept.
