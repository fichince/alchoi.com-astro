That is, they understand the story as a delivery system for their ideas. I know I felt that way. A story was where I got to set the world straight and achieve glory via the sheer originality of my advanced moral positions.\n\nBut, as a technical matter, fiction doesn't support polemic very well. Because the writer invents all the elements, a story isn't really in a position to “prove” anything. (If I make a dollhouse out of ice cream and put it in the sun, it doesn't prove the notion \"Houses melt.\")"

We shouldn't overestimate or unduly glorify what  fiction does. And actually, we should be wary of insisting that it do anything in particular. The critic Dave Hickey has written about this, the notion that saying what art *should* do might enable a reactionary establishment to start saying what it *must* do, and then to begin silencing those artists whose works aren't doing that. In other words, whenever we get up on the soapbox and sing fiction's praises, explaining how good it is for everyone, we're actually limiting its freedom to be... whatever it wants to be (perverse, contrary, frivolous, objectionable, useless, too difficult for any but a few to read, and so on)."

Whatever else you think about Coolidge, the statement does seem more or less correct, and when I came across it for the first time shortly after starting graduate school I thought: At last, I'm pursuing a profession befitting of my neuroses.\n\nThis is because my mind is always turning over this question of how I'm going to feel later, based on what I'm doing now. Later in the day. Later in the week. Later in a life starting to look like a series of activities designed to make me feel good later, but not now. Knowing I'll feel good later makes me feel good enough now. Calvin Coolidge would approve, but according to my mother there is another term for such super-modulated living, and it translates roughly into not being able to live like a dog.\n\nYou would be happier, she has been heard to say, if you were more like your brother. Sami lives in the moment, like a dog."

If God has a definite power over the whole of existence, one can imagine this power extending to His ability, whenever He wills, to replace any given destiny with another destiny. In other words, destiny is not definite but indefinite, mutable by the deliberate actions of man himself; Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. God has not predetermined the course of human history but rather is aware of all its possible courses and may alter the one we're on in accordance with our will and the bounds of His universe."

They find it astonishing that in a nation where politics is far from transparent the economy can develop at such an impressive pace. But they are overlooking, I think, a crucial point: behind China's economic miracle there is a pair of powerful hands pushing things along, and their owner's name is Revolution."

At that point, of course, revolution no longer meant armed struggle so much as a series of political movements, each hot on the heels of the one before, reaching ultimate extremes during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Later, when China reintroduced itself to the world in the guise of a freewheeling, market-driven economy, revolution appeared to have vanished. But in our economic miracle since 1978, revolution never disappeared but simply donned a different costume."

For much of the population who had fled hardships in the mainland and seen Hong Kong as only a temporary refuge, this came in parallel with a growing realisation that a return to the mainland was either impossible or unattractive. At the same time, the post-war baby-boom generation born in Hong Kong were coming of age, and had only ever known Hong Kong as home. All of these forces came together at this moment in Hong Kong's history to forge what would become a distinct people: the Hong Kongers."

The young voice doesn't reflect; it just reacts.\n\nTake these two sentences: \"I had no desire to see my own cervix. The idea seemed distasteful to me in a way that group masturbation wasn't.\"\n\nThe old voice might have stopped the narrative to ask why group masturbation was more acceptable than womb gazing.\n\nThe old voice might have posited the answer: In 1971, what was sexually distasteful was adjudicated by men.\n"

At the height of the Romantic period, say, the 1700s in England, a painting was either pronounced beautiful, a Platonic idealization of nature, or ugly, showing nature unadorned, full of thorns and serpents. In 1971 at CalArts, a piece of art was either redrawing the boundaries of art—or it was pointless."

It is in the feet that all knowledge of Mankind lies hidden; the body sends them a weighty sense of who we really are and how we relate to the earth. It's in the touch of the earth, at its point of contact with the body that the whole mystery is located — the fact that we're built of elements of matter, while also being alien to it, separated from it.

The Person beset by this Ailment becomes taciturn and appears to be lost in contemplation. He develops an interest in various Tools and machinery, and he's drawn to the Second World War and the biographies of famous people, mainly politicians and villains. His capacity to read novels almost entirely vanishes; testosterone autism disturbs the character's psychological understanding. I think Oddball was suffering from this Ailment."

On the one hand we're proud to see that the sky is imprinted on our individual life, like a postmark with a date stamped on a letter — this makes it distinct, one of a kind. But at the same time it's a form of imprisonment in space, like a tattooed prison number. There's no escaping it. I cannot be someone other than I am. How awful. We'd prefer to think we're free, able to reinvent ourselves whenever we choose. This connection with something as great and monumental as the sky makes us feel uncomfortable. We'd rather be small, and then our petty little sins would be forgivable."

My lips were on the point of producing one of these impertinent 'why don't yous' when I bit my tongue.\n\nThat's just what the colour magazines do — just for a moment I'd wanted to be like them: they tell us what we've failed to do, where we've messed up, what we've neglected; ultimately they set us on ourselves, filling us with self-contempt.\n\nSo I didn't say a word. Other people's life stories are not a topic for debate. One should hear them out, and reciprocate in the same coin. So I told Good News about my life too, and invited her to my home to meet my Little Girls. And that's what happened.\n"

Such People are bright and intelligent, but don't apply themselves to their studies, and use their intelligence to play card games or patience instead. They have beautiful bodies, but they destroy them through neglect, poison themselves with harmful substances, and ignore doctors and dentists.\n\nThis Venus induces a strange kind of laziness — lifetime opportunities are missed, because you overslept, because you didn't feel like going, because you were late, because you were neglectful. It's a tendency to be sybaritic, to live in a state of mild semi-consciousness, to fritter your life away on petty pleasures, to dislike effort and be devoid of any penchant for competition.\nLong mornings, unopened letters, things put off for later, abandoned projects. A dislike of any authority and a refusal to submit to it, going your own way in a taciturn, idle manner. You could say such people are of no use at all.\n"

In the last decade, I've learned just how much the benefits of good relationships outweigh their drawbacks, yet it doesn't surprise me that I sometimes fantasize about life without these limitations, that I want it both ways.

The unfortunate influence of this style of reading has dictated that we go to writers of color for the gooey heart-porn of the ethnographic: to learn about forgotten history, harrowing tragedy, community-destroying political upheaval, genocide, trauma; that we expect those writers to provide those intellectual commodities the way their ancestors once provided spices, minerals, precious stones, and unprecious bodies."

The concept of instrumentalizing fiction or art as a kind of ethical protein shake, such that reading more and more diversely will somehow build the muscles in us that will help us see other people as human, makes a kind of superficial sense—and produces a superficial effect. The problem with this type of reading is that in its practical application, usually readers are encouraged—by well-meaning teachers and lazy publishing copy—to read writers of a demographic minority in order to *learn* things; which is to say, as a supplement for their empathy muscles, a metabolic exchange that turns writers of color into little more than ethnographers—personal trainers, to continue the metaphor. The result is that we largely end up going to writers of color to learn the specific—and go to white writers to feel the universal."

We take a deep breath, perhaps learn from the experience that life is too short or unfair, and then move on to the challenges that still lie ahead.\n\nFor seniors, though, this look backward is a vital part of their conscious and subconscious existence.

It was as if isolation had kept them from numbing themselves to the fact of other people. You walk down the sidewalk in Manhattan and maybe you know on some level that every single person you pass is a constellation of memory and perception as huge and unique as whatever's inside you, but there's no way to really appreciate that on a case-by-case basis; you'd lose your mind. You get anesthetized, living among crowds, to the implications of faces. The terra incognita of every gaze, Saul Bellow calls it. Whereas if you walk up to a remote Alaskan, I mean just buying a bag of chips in the village store, a lot of the time the response you get is this sort of HELLO, VAST AND TERRIFYING COSMOS OF PERSONHOOD.

It has more to do with (1) having difficulty focusing one's attention right now, (2) on the most critical task, speaker, or activity, and (3) once focus has been achieved, maintaining it instead of yielding to distraction.\n\nAs one prominent ADHD expert, psychologist Russell Barkley, says, \"The challenge is not knowing what to do. It's in doing what you know.\"\n\nSo, instead of calling it an attention-deficit disorder, we could call it an *intention-inhibition* disorder. That's because it's a condition in which the best intentions go awry."

If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber.

A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.

Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. It is only thus that we evoke his will to meaning from its state of latency. I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, \"homeostasis,\" i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him."

But first among equals, when it comes to necessary ingredients, is selfishness. A book is made out of small selfishnesses. The selfishness of shutting the door against your family. The selfishness of ignoring the pram in the hall. The selfishness of forgetting the real world to create a new one. The selfishness of stealing stories from real people. The selfishness of saving the best of yourself for that blank-faced anonymous paramour, the reader. The selfishness that comes from simply saying what you have to say."

Even if people don't use the documentation or follow what other colleagues are doing, just seeing it creates an innate sense of belonging. There's a trust that's forged because you can see what everyone is doing. Most companies work exactly opposite of that intentionally: they want it fully siloed because they're afraid of too much feedback. But it's not the feedback you should be afraid of; it's alienating teams.”"

As Nikil Saval put it in *Cubed*, white-collar workers \"believed ardently in the American dream of relentless upward mobility. They preferred the insecurity of getting promoted based on merit to the steady advance of seniority. Unions promised one thing above all—dignity—which white-collar workers claimed they already had, and thanks to the prestige of their professions, the bleached stiffness of their collars.\""

It is dire poverty indeed when a man is so malnourished and fatigued that he won't stoop to pick up a penny.

The man has used his sword to shatter the sphere because he wanted to understand it, but now he finds that he has destroyed both sphere and sword. This puzzles him, but at the same time part of him refuses to accept that the sphere is broken and worthless, He has picked up some of the fragments and stares at them intently in the hope that they will eventually bring him new knowledge."

But in the last few years, after the intentionality of the distancing, whenever he'd come to mind, something welled up, making me a little ill, remorseful. I noticed at some point that I have a tendency to hum a single note whenever I think of him. It is not exactly a pleasant sound but more like a sound meant to hide a groan. This strange, sudden, and involuntary emission is a chord made up of the notes of regret, remorse, and guilt. So perhaps my need to get on with a visit with him is not really out of the blue. What is out of the blue is the recognition of this pending visit as a chance to clean up an aspect of my life—a chance to scrub karma, or something like that."

It's as if you go underground, and there are all these shapes and colors, and there you see that, oh, _died_ in this language is closest in color and shape, consistency and texture, to _passed away_ in this other language. And it feels like a personal accomplishment when you make the match and haul the pair back up to the surface. And somehow, I was able to make those matches. I could just _feel_ them. But the problem was that this feeling didn't translate into any kind of significant action, and for reasons I couldn't grasp, I was unable to get to that place I longed to reach. Whatever that gap was between editor and writer, print-copier and painter, midwife and mother, well, I'd spent my whole life trying to leap over that gap and had consistently fallen into the abyss. The truth is, whenever I saw a beautiful painting, or read a great novel, I felt joy, of course, but something in me would also seethe. Jealousy is an ugly thing. Even ambition, particularly in a woman, can be undesirable. But this other feeling—this feeling of a life not fully lived—that was worse, practically unbearable. I felt constantly thwarted, and I didn't even know by what."

According to _The Maine Farmers' Almanac_, which began publication in 1819, a blue moon was considered the third full moon in a season of four. This concept stood for 118 years, until a misinterpretation of the 1937 edition of the _Almanac_ was written up by James Hugh Pruett. Through some unfortunate miscalculation, Pruett took the _Almanac_'s view to mean that a blue moon was the second full moon in a month. How he arrived at this conclusion is anyone's guess, but it oddly became the go-to blue moon definition for many years. It was further popularized in an influential volume of _Sky & Telescope_ magazine in 1946, which was cited throughout the decades, most notably on an episode of the radio show _StarDate_ in 1980. These inconsistencies have persisted, alongside the idiom of improbability, 'once in a blue moon.' And then, of course, there is the observed atmospheric phenomenon wherein smoke and dust particles of a very particular size rise up from the Earth and cast the moon in blue overtones. All this being said, determining the probability of 'a blue moon, in a blue moon, in a blue moon' defies all calculation."

Both crack and crash systems, disrupting the status quo, and in the face of that chaos they thrive. It would be difficult to come up with a more accurate parallel and yet it is a relatively recent one; to effectively peer into the behavior of viruses, networks and computers had to exist. Previous metaphors glossed over aspects of the infection process, or rather, they conceptualized viral action in a less meticulous way. An ancient, biochemical entity required, in a sense, the advent of technology to describe it. This produces a strange crackle in the mind; technology arises from a need, and then its products and processes are absorbed into culture as conceptual frameworks that then reorganize the world. The virus-hacker metaphor allows this mechanism to become visible. Beyond explaining viral behavior this situation reveals how we compose reality, which in turn reveals something else: the connection between the organic matter that makes us and what we ourselves make. This is why, perhaps, information is so susceptible to mutation online. Because we, ourselves, mutate constantly in response to our environment."

To know a picture by heart so well and to recall it accidentally as fact, is this really so different from remembering the flesh-and-bone event that also unfolded in image after image after image? Of course it is different, except not nearly as much as we want it to be, or think it should be, because memory is an invention in the same vein as Instagram or the video camera and we understand it now primarily in relation to all the devices we have built to emulate it. What did memory look like before photography? No one knows. No one remembers. No one is alive to tell us what recollections looked like before we had things that could freeze time and preserve its remnants."

We create the future as it erupts in the present, and later that same future will emerge in a different present, as part of the present moment, but as the past, as memory, when a post is tapped on or scrolled through. All of these posts, all of these recorded documents, show a sprawling network of curated remembrances, but what of the actual experience?

How much of that wanting was what I wanted from myself, from other women, even; how much of what I thought I wanted from a lover came from what I needed from my own mother. Because it's women, in many of the stories I've heard, who have greater hold over other women than men have. We can make each other feel dowdy, whorish, unclean, unloved, not beautiful. In the end, it all comes down to fear. Men can frighten us, other women can frighten us, and sometimes we worry so much about what frightens us that we wait to have an orgasm until we are alone. We pretend to want things we don't want so nobody can see us not getting what we need."

When they come to the end of their life cycle, they put out a final, massive crop of lemons. In their last spring their flowers bud and blossom in enormous bunches and fill the air with a smell so sweet that it stings your nostrils from two blocks away; then their fruits ripen all at once, whole limbs break off due to their excessive weight, and after a few weeks the ground is covered with rotting lemons. It is a strange sight, he said, to see such exuberance before death. One can picture it in animal species, those million salmon mating and spawning before dropping dead, or the billions of herrings that turn the seawater white with their sperm and eggs and cover the coasts of the northeast Pacific for hundreds of miles. But trees are very different organisms, and such displays of overripening feel out of character for a plant and more akin to our own species, with its uncontrolled, devastating growth. I asked him how long my own citrus had to live. He told me that there was no way to know, at least not without cutting it down and looking inside its trunk. But, really, who would want to do that?"

Consider the word “order” itself. It comes from the Latin ordinem, to describe a row of threads sitting neatly in a loom. In time, it was extended as a metaphor to describe the way that people sit neatly under the rule of a king, general, or president. It was only applied to nature in the 1700s under the assumption—a human fabrication, a superimposition, a guess—that there is an orderly set of ranks to find there. I have come to believe that it is our life’s work to tear down this order, to keep tugging at it, trying to unravel it, to set free the organisms trapped underneath. That it is our life’s work to mistrust our measures. Especially those about moral and mental standing. To remember that behind every ruler there is a Ruler.

Readers inflict their own expectations, not just on the story, but on your politics, your philosophy, your stance on all things ethical. You, not your writing, become the product—your looks, your wit, your quippy clapbacks and factional alignments with online beefs that no one in the real world gives a shit about."

Yet as you continue to live in a language you don't know, it becomes increasingly obvious to you how much this category of 'basics' could theoretically encompass. Greetings and everyday interactions are of course basic, and there is always something embarrassing about not knowing basic forms of verbs. Everyone knows numbers are incredibly basic, as are colours, clothes, the subjects you study at school, animals, anything to do with weather, and adjectives for describing people. In fact, we could go ahead and say that every object is also basic, and there is something particularly alarming when you don't know how to say the first words you would have learned in your language(s) as a child: teddy, buggy, shoelace. And then there is the most fundamental-seeming vocabulary of all: abstract nouns, like justice, friendship, pleasure, evil, and vanity."

It's all too easy to conceptualize the rural paradise you move into as a blank canvas for your personal growth, and ignore the existing community; to feel yourself free from the tug of social conscience as you trample across the needs of others, flout social mores, and cause those around you discomfort and labour that you are perfectly unaware of. I tried my best not to act in those ways; at times I succeeded, and at others I failed. But whatever my intentions, the intense feeling of liberation I began to feel was undeniable, and the liberation was mostly from judgement. No longer surrounded by pronouncements that I understood, I let the critic in my head float away and suddenly I found I could do and say things simply because I wanted to. More, as if the obligations clouding my vision washed away, I was far clearer on what the things I wanted to do actually were. It was as if what had been watching me all the time was my language; I had clung to it as the thing that shaped me, but now I was finding that a looser relationship with the language, perhaps having a looser shape altogether, was profoundly healing.

Embarrassingly, this fact took a while to fully sink in, and in my first few weeks I sustained the belief that if, while speaking Japanese, I said English words in my normal accent I would be understood, and would in some sense be 'righter', because those were the 'real' pronunciations. Eventually, of course, I reached the realization that gairaigo were a bona fide part of the Japanese language, and were spoken with authority as such; if I wanted to communicate properly in Japanese, that was how I would have to speak. I would have to say howaitobodo instead of whiteboard, and shitoberuto for seatbelt, and if I didn't then I'd be wrong. If I wanted to talk about a film star, I would have to know how to say their name in the correct katakana pronunciation, otherwise I'd be met with incomprehension. That was just how things were. "

Come on, I want to say, what about all the other stuff? Surely the ways in which your language or your culinary culture has been used or misused is less interesting than almost everything else about that nation, and the experience you had there?

I had relied on my parents and they had taught me to speak; now I had found someone else upon whom I relied, in various senses, albeit to a lesser degree. I had not consciously taken up with Y for that reason, and when I talk now about the chronology of my Japanese learning I tend to cast this the other way round, saying that one of the reasons I kept going was because I happened to fall in love with a Japanese man. And yet when I think about how much I hung on his words, how much the thought of irritating him bothered me even if I pretended otherwise, and how much that encouraged me to ingest not just his words but also the cultural obligations surrounding them, I can't help but think that maybe I, like goodness-knows-how-many other people, had hit unwittingly, almost as if through biological reflex, upon a strategy that would see me into something approaching fluency."

That the reality is often hugely different is something to which the majority of those who speak another language with some fluency will testify: a survey of over a thousand bilinguals found that two-thirds attested to feeling 'like a different person' when speaking different languages. To imagine a language means to imagine a life-form; to assume that you would be the same person in different languages, when not only the norms and rules but most likely also your social status and domains of experience and proficiencies within those languages are likely to be at least slightly if not fundamentally different, seems, when examined, plainly bizarre."

Ultimately, there is one name for Western nations, and it is America. This is not unintelligible to me as a perception, and nor is the antagonism shown towards this arch-nation. I also know that after the events of the Second World War and the Occupation and its aftermath, the emotional stakes run particularly high between Japan and the States. Besides this understanding, though, it strikes me that there's something faintly paradoxical at work here: that the very qualities which supposedly form the bone of contention with the States - its size, power, and supposed crassness - are in fact ratified by singling it out as uniquely visible, as if only such places deserve attention. It puts me in mind of a time back in my first year of junior school, when the playground was ruled by a pair of identical twins. At some point, the twins had an argument, and in no time at all, the entirety of the year was split into two factions, with everyone forced to pick sides. I remember how bizarre it seemed to me, even as a four year-old, that such a dynamic had evolved between two people who lived in the same house, and whom none of the teachers could tell apart - and although the situation with Japan and America was clearly different in almost every way, there was some of the enmeshed quality which felt of a piece.\n"

If our reaction on encountering a dubious translation was to accept that the information provided was insuflicient for our purposes, and perhaps to ask if there was anything we could do to bring us closer to understanding, then all would be well; yet my sense is that there's a tendency on discovering an opaque phrase to leap to the assumption that we won't ever get there, because the concept in question is on some level beyond our understanding - too hazy, strange, mystical. In other words, it's not really about the translation, but rather about some quality in the source language, source culture. It is, after all, very alien.\n"

Uku also means to stick out, to stand out, to be different. It is hard not to see this tangle of meanings as brutally indicative: the price you pay for being carefree is to be a social outcast. Or conversely, the price that you pay for assimilating is to have your consciousness occupied by other people's feelings. I try to steer clear of clichés about Japan as I feel there are too many of them around as it is, but there is a handful of things people say that are, I believe, actually and importantly true, and one of them is this: a key part of being in Japan is that gradually, without realizing, _the state of being unlike others_ comes to seem more and more repellent to you on a subcutaneous level. That this happens even if consciously you totally reject this principle, and even if on a purely physical level you have no hope of doing anything but standing out.

It's not the sort of place that you're supposed to draw security from, or which is supposed to make you happy or prosperous.

What took me longer to figure out was that living on the sand didn't have to be just a running away or an experience of permanent overwhelm. That the topsy-turvy place between languages and cultures, which has been a site of humility and triangulation and self-knowledge, of absurdity and inanity and the best sort of creative fertility, can also offer, paradoxically, a kind of safety.

To throw away his marriage and follow Lalitha had felt irresistible until the moment he saw himself, in the person of Jessica's older colleague, as another overconsuming white American male who felt entitled to more and more and more: saw the romantic imperialism of his falling for someone fresh and Asian, having exhausted domestic supplies. Likewise the course he'd charted for two and a half years with the Trust, convinced of the soundness of his arguments and the rightness of his mission, only to feel, this morning, in Charleston, that he'd made nothing but horrible mistakes. And likewise the overpopulation initiative: what better way to live could there be than to throw himself into the most critical challenge of his time? A challenge that then seemed trumped-up and barren when he thought of his Lalitha with her tubes tied. How to live?"

		"quote": "\"It's all circling around the same problem of personal liberties,\" Walter said. \"People came to this country for either money or freedom. If you don't have money, you cling to your freedoms all the more angrily. Even if smoking kills you, even if you can't afford to feed your kids, even if your kids are getting shot down by maniacs with assault rifles. You may be poor, but the one thing nobody can take away from you is the freedom to fuck up your life whatever way you want to. That's what Bill Clinton figured out—that we can't win elections by running against personal liberties. Especially not against guns, actually.\""

		"quote": "America, for Einar, was the land of unSwedish freedom, the place of wide-open spaces where a son could still imagine he was special. But nothing disturbs the feeling of specialness like the presence of other human beings feeling identically special. Having achieved, through his native intelligence and hard labor, a degree of affluence and independence, but not nearly enough of either, he became a study in anger and disappointment. After his retirement, in the 1950s, he began sending his relatives annual Christmas letters in which he lambasted the stupidity of America's government, the inequities of its political economy, and the fatuity of its religion—drawing, for example, in one particularly caustic Christmas greeting, a cunning parallel between the unwed madonna of Bethlehem and the \"Swedish whore\" Ingrid Bergman, the birth of whose own \"bastard\" had lately been celebrated by American media controlled by \"corporate interests.\" Though an entrepreneur himself, Einar detested big business. Though he'd made a career of government contracts, he hated the government as well. And though he loved the open road, the road made him miserable and crazy. He bought American sedans with the biggest engines available, so that he could do ninety and a hundred on the dead-flat Minnesota state highways, many of them built by him, and roar past the stupid people in his way. If an oncoming car approached him at night with its high beams on, Einar's response was to put his own high beams on and leave them on. If some pinhead dared to try to pass him on a two-lane road, he floored the accelerator to keep pace and then decelerated to prevent the would-be passer from getting back in line, taking special pleasure when there was danger of a collision with an oncoming truck. If another driver cut him off or refused him the right of way, he pursued the offending car and tried to force it off the road, so that he could jump out and shout curses at its driver. (The personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage.)"
