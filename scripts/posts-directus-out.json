		"content": "The emotional core of _Freedom_, for me, was the love triangle between married couple Walter and Patty Berglund, and Walter’s rock star best friend, Richard. The three met in college, and for Patty, it was the classic choice: lust for the wild and dangerous musician, or the comfort of the responsible nice guy.\n\nThe book has an interesting structure, starting with a section told from the perspective of the Berglund’s suburban neighbours. It’s got a gossipy feel, like they see the cracks in the marriage, but can only speculate on the couple’s true nature from a distance.\n\nThen, we get a chapter that’s taken from Patty’s therapeutic journal. She writes about her life story in the third person, but inserts running commentary as “the autobiographer,” often with self-deprecating or rueful reflections. I thought it was a really compelling way to dive into a character.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n> The autobiographer has no doubt that if Patty had been more conscious of herself and paying any halfway decent kind of attention to the world around her, she wouldn't have been nearly as good at college basketball. Success at sports is the province of the almost empty head. \n\nThe middle of the book dragged a bit for me, as it shifts focus to Richard and Walter, and the Berglund’s son, Joey. The latter’s chapters especially grated on me: sure, it may be true that young men go through life in a state of almost-constant sexual arousal, but I felt like it was meant to titillate rather than illuminate the character. And ultimately, I thought he took away focus from the core triangular relationship.\n\nAlong the way, the book explores Walter’s professional life, and his approach to environmentalism. In his role as a corporate lawyer, he brokers a land deal which would allow an energy company to mine coal by blasting it from mountaintops. As objectionable as that sounds, he justifies it because his actual goal is ostensibly to transform the land into a conservation area for birds, after the mining is complete. Further, he intends to use the PR funds at his disposal to launch a campaign against population growth, which he believes to be the root cause of the climate crisis. Ultimately, I think he’s pretty misguided about his mission[^freedom-1], but what’s not so clear is whether the book condones and celebrates Walter’s deeds, or whether we are meant to feel sorry for him for trying so hard on a clearly ineffectual venture.\n\nThe novel ends with a hopeful reconciliation for the Berglunds. I thought it happened too quickly: Patty just shows up at Walter’s hosue after a long separation, and then by the next page, they’re together again. Franzen is so good at writing the earlier scenes of conflict, and the fact that they resolve their differences without having any conversation about it is disappointing. On the other hand, I did feel glad that our characters had a happy ending, which sums up my experience with the book on the whole: it was entertaining and hard to put down, despite my disappointment with the lack of substance in some key areas.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cfbc67b6-14dc-4e7c-add9-fa9537c3aa27)\n\n[hardcover link](https://hardcover.app/books/freedom)\n\n[^freedom-1]: See [Hannah Ritchie](/blog/2025/01/not-the-end-of-the-world)’s breakdown of the [overpopulation myth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrbyI-Cuze4).\n",

		"content": "I loved [_Magnolia_](https://letterboxd.com/film/magnolia/) and [_There Will Be Blood_](https://letterboxd.com/film/there-will-be-blood/) back when they came out, but I have to admit that [Paul Thomas Anderson](https://letterboxd.com/director/paul-thomas-anderson/)’s films since then have left me a bit cold.\n\nI’m happy to say that _One Battle After Another_ entertained me more than [_Phantom Thread_](https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-thread/) or [_Inherent Vice_](https://letterboxd.com/film/inherent-vice/) did. I saw it in IMAX and it was worth it for the close-up performance moments alone, especially by Sean Penn. His character is strange and twitchy and seems deformed somehow, and those quirks really come through when his face fills my entire field of vision.\n\nThere’s more action in this than PTA’s usual fare, including a brilliant car chase scene that features rolling desert hills. What starts off as a visual flourish—hypnotizing POV shots that follow the ups and downs of the road—becomes a tactic that a character uses against their pursuer. I would have cheered out loud if I were the type of person to do that.\n\nWhat I’m struggling with, though, is the politics of the movie. The film depicts a conflict between characters from the extremes of the political spectrum. On one side is a terrorist group, committing violent crimes in the name of immigrant rights, and against the capitalist establishment. On the other side is a secretive, Santa-worshipping white supremacist club, whose members are in positions of high power and who do not shy away from an assassination or two. Both are shown as being ridiculous, and as far as I know, neither actually exist in real life. The US is a polarized country, and I feel like this movie gives fuel for both sides to say, “This is why _they_ are to be feared.” The world of the movie feels just real enough that it filled me with dread about the future of American society. Which I guess was the point.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/one-battle-after-another/)",

		"content": "It’s refreshing to watch an animated movie that isn’t hyperkinetic and full of jibber-jabbering. _Flow_ takes it completely in the other direction: it has no dialogue at all and contains many long unbroken takes with a gently floating virtual camera.\n\nThe story follows a cat who lives in a land with steadily rising water levels, and apparently abandoned by humanity. The sense of peril as the cat tries to flee from the flood really stressed me out, both because it evokes the threat of climate change, and because of the danger to the character herself. (I thought of the cat as female, but the film does not state this explicitly.) Eventually, she forms a found family with a group of other animals, including a dog and a lemur, and they set out on a mission to find safety.\n\nI enjoyed watching the animals interact with each other. The filmmakers did a great job of balancing their natural animal behaviours with just enough anthropomorphized personality to make them distinct characters. I imagine it would be fun to watch this movie with a kid, because you could have great open-ended conversations about what each of the creatures is thinking or feeling; the movie doesn’t feed you that information, but rewards close observation and empathy.\n\n_Flow_ was produced using [open-source software](https://www.blender.org/user-stories/making-flow-an-interview-with-director-gints-zilbalodis/) on a small budget. I’m not going to say that it looks as polished as a Pixar movie—there are some flaws in the rendering and character models—but the aesthetic is pleasant to look at, with a soft colour palette and lifelike animation. I think it’s a great lesson in embracing the limitations of your tools and making the best of them.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/flow-2024/)",

Most of these movies don’t invite much analysis, so this will be a really quick rundown of my thoughts.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n## [_Thunderbolts*_](https://letterboxd.com/film/thunderbolts/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nPeople are calling this a return to form for the struggling MCU, and while I do admire the story and how it deals with depression and mental health, I miss the flashier superpowers of the top-tier heroes. Assembling a team of sidekick-level characters really highlights the fact that their powers are weaker by design so as to not steal thunder from the stars.\n\n## [_Sinners_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sinners-2025/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.cloud/assets/d61d113f-e4d2-4769-b630-5fd3479064cc)\n\nUndoubtedly original, and contains one of the best scenes in recent memory: a musical performance that travels through time. I have to admit though that I had trouble understanding the dialogue through the Southern accents, and I probably missed some of the subtleties. As a result, I thought the structure of the story was a bit choppy. Will probably benefit from a rewatch (with subtitles).\n\n## [_Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning_](https://letterboxd.com/film/mission-impossible-the-final-reckoning/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThe plot is really quite stupid, with a mission that involves luring an evil AI program into a USB key, and then unplugging it at exactly the right moment so that it doesn’t escape. That’s not how computers work! But the climactic stunt sequence, involving Tom Cruise climbing on and hanging off a biplane in the air, is truly impressive. Thumbs up to that one scene, thumbs down to the rest of the movie.\n\n## [_Jurassic World Rebirth_](https://letterboxd.com/film/jurassic-world-rebirth/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThe _Jurassic_ movie series has always tried to one-up itself by introducing a new dinosaur species in each entry. The whole conceit centres around genetic engineering, so it does make logical sense that they can invent new creatures. But for me, this movie crossed a line: the design of the final boss monster doesn’t even look like a dinosaur anymore. Even though no human has ever seen a dinosaur, we as a society seem to drawn certain boundaries within which we can categorize an animal as “dinosaur-like,” and the “_Distortus rex_” in this movie somehow lands outside of those boundaries. It didn’t work for me, but having said that, I actually did enjoy the various action set pieces of the film.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.cloud/assets/e9b7a2fe-bf59-4bb3-ba2c-a0e8887489ca)\n\n## [_Superman_](https://letterboxd.com/film/superman-2025/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nOne of the most cartoonish superhero movies, in a good way, I guess.

After a while, it’s just like _car-car-car-crash-drive-drive-drive-crash-race-race-race-crash_. And I wasn’t a fan of the attitude of Brad Pitt’s main character… you’re supposed to root for how he doesn’t play by the rules and doesn’t respect his opponents, but to me, it’s poor sportmanship.\n\n## [_The Fantastic Four: First Steps_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.cloud/assets/8c12fb48-480f-4c9d-9cf5-8b20bb0ae9c2)\n\nSkipping the traditional superhero origin story is a double-edged sword. It’s true that audiences are probably tired of seeing it. On the other hand, by reducing the character introductions to a quick montage, this movie felt really choppy to me at the start. I’m somewhat familiar with the characters from cultural osmosis, but a total newcomer might find it disorienting. But once the movie settles in, I enjoyed it, especially the effects and animation for the villains, Silver Surfer and Galactus.\n\n## [_Weapons_](https://letterboxd.com/film/weapons-2025/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThe mysterious trailers and marketing make it this year’s [_Longlegs_](/blog/2024/10/halloween-binge), but I think this is a much better horror film. I love the way the movie reveals its secrets bit-by-bit, by jumping between character perspectives. The way it mixes humour and horror is a lot of fun. Made a fan of Julia Garner out of me. I can’t wait to watch it again.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.cloud/assets/a14070c2-e3d9-44e7-81bc-40ba7bfee015)\n\n## [_Ne Zha 2_](https://letterboxd.com/film/ne-zha-2/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nI saw this on an IMAX screen, and it’s fittingly big and loud. I didn’t watch the first movie, and I’m also not very familiar with the underlying Chinese mythology, so I didn’t really understand the story. But as pure eye candy, it’s hard to beat.",

I wasn’t a fan of the [previous entry](/blog/2025/06/foundations-edge), so I was a little worried about _Foundation and Earth_. Fortunately, I thought it was a huge improvement. It’s a direct continuation from _Foundation’s Edge_, so in hindsight, it’s almost as if the previous book was all a setup for the truly compelling part of the story.\n\nI didn’t like the messy parallel plotlines in _Foundation’s Edge_, and so the main thing I appreciated about this one was its focus on a single group of characters, who are embarking on a single quest. We have Trevize, a member of the Foundation who’s got the weight of the galaxy on his shoulders, and his best bud, Pelorat, a scholar and all-round chill guy. Pelorat’s romantic partner, Bliss, is also part of the crew, and it’s in this three-sided dynamic that I got most of my enjoyment. It’s surprisingly sweet and relatable, how Trevize distrusts Bliss, simply because she’s Pelorat’s new girlfriend, and he doesn’t want his pal to get hurt. Add to that the conflict between Trevize’s and Bliss’s viewpoints about the fate of the galaxy, and you have some real satisfying character development.\n\nThe book is by no means perfect… I think it could have used some editing, because the debates between Trevize and Bliss, while thematically relevant, often feel repetitive, hitting the same beats over and over again. And any time a new female character was introduced, I cringed in anticipation of the inevitable tasteless description of [her body](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/breasted-boobily).\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nAs for how this pair of sequels ties into the whole of the series, my reaction is a bit mixed. Since I read the [prequels](/blog/2024/11/prelude-to-foundation) [first](/blog/2024/12/forward-the-foundation) (prequels which were written _after_ this book), I kind of knew what the ultimate reveal was going to be. **_Spoilery thoughts ahead_**:\n\nI’m pretty disappointed that the central concept of Hari Seldon’s psychohistory is basically discarded after the original trilogy. Seldon’s plan was supposed to be a prediction of how a thousand years of human history would play out, based on the behaviour of large populations. In the sequels and prequels, we find out that there is a single god-like entity pulling the strings the whole time. On the one hand, it’s cool that this one character is connected to Asimov’s other novels, creating a shared universe; but on the other hand, I would have really liked to have an answer to the question: did the Seldon Plan actually work? More to the point: did it matter?\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4d9d877c-f2d1-42a2-bb9d-a2528cada4f9)\n\n[hardcover link](https://hardcover.app/books/foundation-and-earth)",

Whoever wins will inherit a fortune, which fortune takes the form of an extensive wine collection. The premise sounds crazy, and it didn’t surprise me to learn that the story is adapted from a manga. The comic-booky feeling is even more pronounced when we realize that these people have a preternatural ability to identify the component flavours of wine just by smelling it, and that they must train to perfect their “powers” before the big “battle.” But throughout it all, the show has the gloss and high production value of a prestige drama.

I really don’t have any criticisms with it, and I think cast and crew did a great job.\n\nIt’s more a case of the film not matching my vibe, or maybe vice versa, that _I_ didn’t have the right energy to fully enjoy the viewing experience. The first act, wherein Ani and Vanya have a whirlwind romance, is like watching a series of the most fun parties you’ve ever been to. As an introvert, though, no matter how great a party is, I’m still going to want to leave.\n\nOnce the conflict kicks in, and the adults who oversee Vanya’s life threaten to break the couple apart, the movie becomes a frantic comedy of errors.

It’s funny, in a [_Curb Your Enthusiasm_](/blog/2024/04/curb-your-enthusiasm) kind of way, but unlike that show, it’s turned up to 11 for a pretty big chunk of the movie. Larry David at least knew how to mix up the rhythm so that not every scene is a shouting match.\n\nThe final chapter of the movie was my favourite: it slows down and gives us a few reflective one-on-one moments between Ani and Igor, one of the “thugs” sent to enforce Vanya’s parents’ wishes. I would have liked the film a lot less if it didn’t have this epilogue, which makes the characters—and we, the viewers—think about everything that just happened, and what it all meant.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/anora/)",

The sociological ideas that were at the forefront of the original books are kind of in the background now, replaced by a more conventional sci-fi adventure.\n\nThe setup of the novel doubles down on the mind-control conceit introduced in the previous books: Trevize, a councilman of the Foundation, suspects that the Second Foundation is secretly pulling the strings of human history using their “mentalic” powers. At the same time, Gendibal, one of the leaders of the Second Foundation, also suspects that there’s _yet another_ more powerful force out there, mentally controlling _them_. \n\nFor me, this made the mind-control plot device feel tired: if there’s always the possibility that some unseen force is actually calling the shots, then as a reader, I lose track of the characters’ motivations. I also found the two protagonists too similar: they’re both young and arrogant iconoclasts who don’t toe the party line, hunting for a hidden adversary, and to me, the two parallel storylines started to blend together.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n(spoilers ahead)\n\nThe ultimate controlling force turns out to be a planet called Gaia, and most of the middle of the book is spent hunting for this mysterious world.

I got confused, thinking that Earth and Gaia were actually the same, but it turns out that Earth doesn’t play a role at all (until the [next entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Earth) in the series, apparently).\n\nFor these reasons, this ended up being my least favourite of the series so far. It really dragged in the middle for me, and the plot is somewhat messy. The ending does introduce an interesting choice for Trevize to make, but we’ll have to see how it pays off in the next book.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/237267a3-09ea-455a-8a59-b25a97fffca1)\n\n[hardcover link](https://hardcover.app/books/foundations-edge)",

I’m already quite cynical about Big Tech, and I thought that this would only entrench my biases further, with no real benefit to my mental health. But I saw it sitting on the shelf at my library and I just couldn’t help myself.\n\nThe author, Sarah Wynn-Williams, worked at Facebook in the global policy department, where her responsibility was (ostensibly) to help the company negotiate with countries around the world. She started with the optimism typical of tech companies in the early aughts, believing that she would “make the world a better place.” But over the course of the book, she becomes disillusioned by Facebook’s relentless pursuit of growth and profit, which came at the high cost of creating political instability in countries like Myanmar and ultimately the US.\n\nNone of this is very surprising, if you follow the news about social media companies over the last few years. But Wynn-Williams’ position gave her access to the top brass at Facebook, Cheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, and she reveals some really bizarre behaviour by the leaders of the company. For example, Zuckerberg once asked her, on a visit to Indonesia, to organize a “gentle mob,” for no apparent reason other than to make himself look cool. These sections were both hard to read and hard to put down, having the feeling of learning some juicy gossip about someone you don’t like. You kind of have to take her word for it, because corroboration from other sources is not really built into the narrative style, but if it’s true, these incidents confirm the old adage that power corrupts.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f7e3106d-7f4f-4c91-9bf3-e894d9028986)\n\n[hardcover link](https://hardcover.app/books/careless-people-2025)\n\n\n",

		"content": "Based purely on the title, I went into this book expecting something different. Maybe it’s just where my mind is at these days, but I thought it would be a treatise against the [democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding) associated with certain world leaders that I won’t name. But it turns out that Dave Meslin’s book is an exploration of the actual governing process, and reads more like a business/management manual, but applied to the systems of democracy. It’s more about logistics than political ideology.\n\nPersonally, my experience with democracy is somewhat intermittent: just go vote whenever there’s an election. It’s not very satisfying because it doesn’t feel like you’re contributing much, especially if your choice doesn’t win. Meslin agrees, and puts the blame on the systems and institutions of the government. And from there, he suggests tons of ideas of ways for those systems to change. I had many “a-ha!” moments reading this book, and I appreciated that the book is Canadian through and through, filled with examples and stories from nearby places.\n\nMeslin is an excellent explainer, and simplifies complicated ideas, making them easy to digest. For example, he spends a lengthy chunk of pages describing alternatives to the [first-past-the-post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) electoral system that we use in Canada. It’s kind of a geeky subject, but he makes it really clear how our current voting system leads to polarization and unfair election results.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI’ll spend the rest of this space listing some of the more enlightening ideas in point form:\n\n- The government suffers from poor UX (user experience). I mostly associate this term with software design, but it can be applied to real world settings. Government spaces are unwelcoming, making it intimidating for ordinary people who want to participate. For example, city council meetings that are supposed to be open to the public are held behind closed doors. The simple act of opening the door and having clear signage would make a huge difference.\n- In the Canadian parliament, the legislators are seated according to their party. This automatically sets up a confrontational vibe of one side vs. the other, and leads to the embarassing shouting matches that we often see. Meslin suggests random seating, which would force a sort of mingling between adversaries and a more respectful atmosphere.\n- There’s a subtle difference between charities and non-profit advocacy groups. The former is a legal designation and allows donations to be tax deductible. However, in order to receive the designation, a charity has to refrain from advocating for policy changes, and instead focus on band-aid type solutions. For example, a food bank is a charity, and while it is important to help feed those in need, a food bank is not allowed to advocate for preventing the upstream root causes of poverty. Advocacy groups, on the other hand, purposely avoid registering as charities, so that they can be more critical of systemic problems. Donating to these groups is a vote for change, even if you don’t get a tax deduction on the donation.\n\nThere’s a lot more in the book, and I would recommend it to anyone who’s interested in how the government works, beyond the rhetoric.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4b603892-b75b-4ba3-937f-db784195064e)\n",

		"content": "A while back, [I wrote about](/blog/2017/04/kobos-killer-app) my history with e-readers, and highlighted in particular the [Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_%28service%29) app that’s available on [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com/) devices. I named it “Kobo’s killer app,” because I think that e-readers hit their sweet spot with long articles: for shorter pieces, I can live with the slight eyestrain of reading on a phone or computer screen, and for full-length books, I’ll always prefer a physical copy. For me, e-readers are perfect for the in-between articles and essays that can be read in 15-30 minutes, and Pocket is the key piece of software that makes it happen. That is, until now.\n\nSadly, the Pocket service [will be shutting down](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/mozilla-is-killing-its-pocket-and-fakespot-services-to-focus-on-firefox/). There are [other](https://www.instapaper.com/) [alternatives](https://hq.getmatter.com/) for saving articles, but there’s no (easy) way to access them on the Kobo.\n\nWhat to do? Luckily, the open-source community comes to the rescue.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n[Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) is a program that can save web pages for later reading, just like Pocket does. You can run your own server, either on a home machine or in the cloud, so you’re not chained to any company that may require subscriptions or cease to exist someday. I’ve deployed my own instance using [Fly.io](https://fly.io/). Saved articles can be downloaded using an iOS or Android app (also open-source) for offline reading.\n\nThe final link in the chain is getting the saved articles onto the Kobo. Enter [KOReader](https://koreader.rocks/), a sort-of Swiss Army Knife of reading apps. Among many other things, it can download and view articles from a Wallabag server. Somehow, the developers managed to find a way to install this app on Kobo devices, which isn’t an open platform as far as I can tell.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole process requires some technical expertise, and if I’m honest, the UI/UX of both Wallabag and KOReader are mediocre. But I’m still happy that I was able to do this, so that the value of my Kobo reader didn’t immediately diminish.",

		"content": "By coincidence, I experienced a funny bit of synergy by reading this book and watching the show [_Bad Sisters_](/blog/2025/05/bad-sisters) at the same time. They’re both murder mysteries set in Ireland, and bled together slightly in my mind. I started to imagine the detective character in the book with the same appearance as the actor in the series. And because my ear had been hearing the spoken dialogue, I was able to mentally approximate the sound of the Irish accent while reading.\n\nThe novel is told from the perspective of Toby, and before the main mystery even kicks in, he gets assaulted by burglers breaking into his home, leaving him with a head injury. As he’s recovering at his fancy family home, his cousin’s kids accidentally discover a skeleton inside a tree in the yard. It shouldn’t be too much of a spoiler to say that the body belongs to someone from Toby’s high school days[^witch-elm-1], and various members of his family—his uncle and his cousins—all become suspects. Including Toby himself.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI enjoyed the prose style of this book. Tana French does a good job getting into Toby’s head, as well as his family members. Despite the book’s length (500+ pages), it feels fast-paced. It’s probably a bit longer than it needs to be, if all you cared about was the mystery, but I don’t fault the author for fleshing out the characters.\n\nUltimately, though, the story didn’t fully work for me. My problems stem from the fact that Toby is the sole point-of-view character. As readers, we’re supposed to wonder whether or not he was the culprit, and since we’re in his head, the plot requires him to not remember the events surrounding the murder. His head injury becomes a convenient plot device, because it causes memory loss, making him unsure about his own guilt. But as more and more layers of truth are revealed and at every turn, Toby is surprised at learning about something that happened _to him_, his selective amnesia begins to feel _too_ convenient and contrived.\n\nOne of the themes of the book is Toby’s privilege. He comes from a wealthy family, and was in with the popular crowd in high school, which made him oblivious to his cousins being bullied. _It can’t be that bad_ is kind of his default attitude. I like the exploration of this theme, but again, the memory loss idea undercuts it somewhat. The point is supposed to be that his position in the social pecking order blinds him to the plights of others, but since his mental dysfunction hangs over everything, it’s like the book always gives him a (valid) excuse for his lack of empathy.\n\n[^witch-elm-1]: From the _makes-me-feel-old_ department: Toby and his cousins reminisce often about their time in high school, which is about 10 years before the present timeframe of the novel. It threw me for a loop that their adolescent lives were filled with technological artifacts— text messages, e-mails, digital photos, location tracking from cell towers—all of which become important pieces of evidence for the mystery. I’m so used to nostalgic high school memories being relatively analogue, but I guess there are fully grown adults now who grew up in a digitally connected world…\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/893ae67f-d0af-4428-895d-7c98a4cd0799)",

		"content": "[_Bad Sisters_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Sisters) tells the story of five sisters, one of whom is married to a crappy husband. The other four sisters all hate him, and they hatch a plot to kill him. The show follows two timelines: it starts with the man’s funeral, and depicts the aftermath as insurance investigators dig into the suspicious circumstances of his death; and then, via flashbacks, we see the sisters’ plan(s) come together (or not).\n\nThe show is a delicate balance between comedy and drama. It has to make us root for murder, and it almost doesn’t work sometimes. The four sisters have really good chemistry, each likeable in her own way, and it’s often funny to watch them interact. But I think the greatest strength of the show is its depiction of the villain, JP. At first, he seems merely rude and disrespectful towards his wife (and everyone else), and I wouldn’t necessarily have described him as abusive for the first few episodes. But as his bad behaviour escalates, the show effectively redefines his belligerence as the tip of the iceberg, just a subtle sign of the deeper abuses going on.\n\nThe fate of JP is fully resolved in the first season, and it’s a satisfying story. There’s a second season, but after watching a couple of episodes, I noticed a significant drop in quality, and decided to quit. I think that the consequences of JP’s death tips the scale towards darkness, so that the light comedic tone is no longer convincing, and ends up feeling discordant and awkward.",

		"content": "I just finished reading the third and final [Fitzcarraldo Editions](https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/) book that I bought in London last year (after [_The Observable Universe_](/blog/2024/11/the-observable-universe) and [_Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead_](/blog/2025/02/drive-your-plow)). I really like the minimalist cover design and the quality of the paper that they use. The books have heft in my hand, and the pages are sturdy and satisfying to turn. I (and most readers, I’m guessing) don’t normally pay much attention to the physical “style” of a given publisher, so kudos to them for creating such a distinctive ethos.\n\n_Fifty Sounds_ is a memoir by Polly Barton about her experiences as an Englishwoman living in Japan. She’s now known for translating Japanese literature to English, which implies that she’s mastered the language, but as she tells it in this book, there’s a gap that’s essentially impossible to cross for a non-native speaker.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nThe title refers to a feature of Japanese called [_mimetics_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_sound_symbolism), i.e. words that represent some abstract idea through a sound. An admittedly awkward example in English might be “They came in to paint the house, _bang-bang_, real quick and they were done.” This type of speech is apparently much more common in Japanese. Each of the fifty chapters in the book recounts Barton’s experiences while connecting to the feeling or concept that one of these mimetics evokes.\n\nI enjoyed her writing style, which is witty and somewhat formal. The most compelling parts for me dealt with relationships that she had with people that she met in Japan. For example, she had a romantic relationship with a man when she was still new to the country and the language, which was fraught with complications, including the obvious language and cultural barriers, but also the confusing question of whether she was conflating her falling in love with a new place with her feelings for the person.\n\nMy main criticism of the book is its repetitiveness. She often hits the same note of feeling out of place and not fitting in, which is of course natural for a newcomer to any country, but for her, is also a reflection of her anxious personality and low self-esteem. She reveals her flaws honestly and effectively, which is always commendable in a memoir, but I would have gotten the idea without it being brought up quite so many times. Perhaps the title was too catchy to discard… _Forty Sounds_ or even _Thirty-Five Sounds_ might have been enough, but doesn’t roll off the tongue as easily.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f27457e4-6cb7-43cb-8385-759fd593c998)",

I found myself unable to really connect with anything I was reading. But even through my own numbness, I admired the author’s work.\n\n_All Our Ordinary Stories_ is a graphic memoir by Chinese-Canadian author Teresa Wong, who attempts to bridge the emotional distance between her and her immigrant parents by exploring their histories. Her parents lived through extreme events, escaping from the Cultural Revolution in China by swimming to Hong Kong. Wong struggles to understand their experiences because they don’t talk about their past. Partly, Chinese culture celebrates stoicism, and encourages them to bottle up their traumas; but also, there’s a language barrier between the generations that makes it hard to have any deep conversations.\n\nI also can’t speak the language of my ancestors very well, but I’m uncomfortable speaking English with my parents because it seems disrespectful somehow. Some scenes in this book capture the communication gap so well that it feels both boring and profound at the same time: boring, because I’ve internalized the experience so much that it’s become run-of-the-mill, ordinary; but profound, because _someone else_ has written it down and aired it out and shown how challenging it really is.\n\nIt’s a rare occurrence that a book hits this close to home… I may wish to revisit this book sometime when I’m more able to engage with it, but I’m almost afraid to do so because it may destroy me.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/eb598f27-a1ea-4942-be92-a8ff56bb032e)",

		"content": "First, the positives: the visual design and rhythm of this film are full of energy, which makes it fun to watch. It goes really over the top with the gore—[I watch everything with subtitles](https://www.vox.com/videos/23564218/subtitles-sound-downmixing-dialogue-movies-tv), and I’ve never seen the word _squelching_ used as much as this film does when describing its sound effects—but then I found myself desensitizing to the squirmy discomfort, to the point where I was giggling gleefully at the gruesome moments by the end.\n\nUnfortunately, I found the storytelling to be weak otherwise. The Substance in the film causes the main character Elisabeth (Demi Moore) to “birth” a second, younger version of herself named Sue (Margaret Qualley). The rules that come with the Substance state that they “are one,” and that they must switch every seven days.\n\nAfter watching the film, I couldn’t help but brainstorm about the possible permutations of the idea. In essence, the movie could have explored the concept in three ways, each with differing psychological consequences on the characters.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n1. two minds, one body: Elisabeth and Sue are distinct personalities, but their body changes appearance, aging and de-aging every seven days. It would be like a twist on [_Severance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_%28TV_series%29), which tends to ask questions like: who’s the _real_ version of this person?\n2. one mind, two bodies: only Elisabeth exists, and her consciousness jumps between the younger and older bodies. Any damage that she does to the older body while she’s in the younger body is her own choice. She has to wrestle with the trade-off between enjoying youth and prolonging life in her golden years.\n3. two minds, two bodies: they’re just two separate people. This is what the movie does, and it’s the least interesting version, in my opinion. If Elisabeth doesn’t experience the life that Sue leads, what does she have to gain from the whole thing in the first place? The repeated mantra that they “are one” doesn’t actually apply.\n\nFinally, I felt that the movie undercuts its own message. Ostensibly, it’s about the harms of objectifying women’s bodies, but then it constantly shows those bodies in titillating camera angles. As a heterosexual man, am I not supposed to enjoy seeing the shapely ass that you keep zooming in on?\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-substance/)",

It’s been around for a while, originating from a viral [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/cesar_kuriyama_one_second_every_day) given by its creator.\n\nI made the mistake of trying it for the first time in 2020. Obviously, the pandemic lockdown took away the opportunity to spend time out in the world, and I gave up because I got tired of taking videos of the same things every day. For some reason, the idea popped into my head again recently, so I decided to give it another shot.\n\nThe name of the app is kind of a misnomer. While you can make a video that is strictly only 1 second per day, I find the result way too fast and choppy. I prefer doing 2-3 seond clips, usually with more than one a day.\n\nHere’s my finished video from the month of March 2025.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XopbiTvvdtw?si=SaH0FRKqDwj0ImkS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n",

The conceit is fertile ground for exploring ideas like, what makes a person a person, and what makes this person _this specific_ person? On paper, it’s right up my alley, but I didn’t enjoy the show as much as I expected to.\n\nI think I had trouble connecting with the characters because the animation and voice acting felt a bit flat. The story deals with a lot of heavy emotions, like grief for a departed loved one, and the choice of whether to accept the Uploaded version of that loved one as the same person. But those feelings didn’t come through for me because the animation just didn’t have the same expressiveness as, say, [_Arcane_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcane_%28TV_series%29), or anything from [Studio Ghibli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli).\n\nOn the positive side, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch. The various Uploaded characters often “fight” each other in the virtual world. Technically, there shouldn’t be anything to look at, as it’s essentially pieces of software trying to hack into each other’s networks, but the creators of the show chose to visualize it as if the Uploads were superheroes. They fly around and use “powers” against each other… sometimes it feels almost like a [_Dragon Ball_](/blog/2025/03/dragon-ball-daima) fight. ",

A twist on the [_Groundhog Day_](https://letterboxd.com/film/groundhog-day/) formula, with a couple of key differences:\n\n- the loop is only 2 minutes long, rather than the whole day, so we can see every iteration in its entirety, in real-time\n- all of 10 or so characters are experiencing the same thing, which introduces an aspect of project management, as they assign tasks to each other and scramble to complete them within the 2 minutes\n\nThe first act is a lot of fun as the characters figure out what’s going on. Seeing how each person reacts is pretty funny… for example, one of the guests is a writer under pressure from his publishers, and he decides to use the time loop as a chance to rest, because it means that his deadlines will never come.\n\nThe movie surprised and impressed me with how it used its structure to illuminate emotional truths for some characters. For example, a young couple challenge themselves to escape from the others, by running away as far as they can. At first, it felt silly to me, since they know that they’ll always end up back where they started. But then I realized that the futility of the game was the point, and that it was a way for them to connect with each other, like a series of rapid-fire “dates.”\n\nAlong the way, the major characters wonder whether they caused the loop by wishing for time to stop. Everyone has a reason for fearing the future, and the natural response to this fear is wanting to just keep things as they are. The movie has a real [“Monkey’s Paw”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey%27s_Paw) kind of message: there’s a fine line between staying in our comfort zones, and becoming stuck in a rut. We need time to move forward, even with all the scary uncertainty that progress brings.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/river-2023-1/)",

Over the course of reading the three books, I could sense that Isaac Asimov was gaining in confidence and skill. The style of the first novel was somewhat staid and dry, but by this third book, his writing had gained some flourishes, making it more fun to read.\n\nBy introducing the Mule and his powers in [_Foundation and Empire_](/blog/2025/03/foundation-and-empire), the series added a new layer to the plotting. Both the Mule and the Second Foundation—a secretive parallel counterpart to the First Foundation that we’ve been following so far—possess mental abilities, which allows them to brainwash and control the actions of ordinary people.\n\nMuch of this novel feels like a spy thriller. Characters form alliances, but nobody can be fully trusted, because anyone can be a secret agent under the control of the other side. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the conclusion involves a series of scenes where an answer is revealed, only to be turned around with a twist, and the _real_ answer being revealed… but then there’s another twist, etc. It’s almost comical how many times it undercuts itself, but I had a blast with it.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4a9c76d3-2327-4713-b275-139b67d1a176)",

		"content": "I’m not a parent. That ship has sailed for me, and there was a time when a twinge of envy would come over me whenever I encountered someone with children. A show like [_Adolescence_](https://www.thetvdb.com/series/adolescence) takes that feeling of envy and replaces it with a deep appreciation for just how hard parenting can be.\n\nThe miniseries tells the story of a teenage boy who gets arrested and charged with stabbing and killing his classmate. It explores his motives, his school life, his relationship with the victim—a girl who he was involved with, in a confused teenage way—and especially, the effect of these events on his parents.\n\nThe current hype around this show mostly centres around the fact that each of the four 1-hour episodes is filmed in a single shot. I don’t have much to say about that aspect of it, other than kudos to the whole cast and crew for pulling it off. It’s truly impressive.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nAt times, I felt the story was a little thin, like it was telling the viewer the most obvious tip of the iceberg. For example, as part of the police investigation, characters mention the [manosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere) and name-drop [Andrew Tate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tate), but there isn’t much detail beyond that. I think I can excuse some of these shortcuts as a limitation of the real-time filmmaking: there just isn’t a natural way to go deep into an idea when characters are in the middle of an intense conversation.\n\nThe really heart-wrenching moments of the show come from the parents of the accused boy. The father, played by Stephen Graham, really struggles to make sense of the violent event, expressing how he tried really hard not to repeat his own father’s corporal punishment.\n\nI was reminded of [this line](/quoteshelf/andrew-solomon) from Andrew Solomon’s [_Far From the Tree_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1ae7067d-1ec1-40b0-be1c-b5e13c3acd5a):\n\n> Though many of us take pride in how different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different our children are from us.\n\nParenting is a struggle between imparting a positive influence on your children, while encouraging them to form their own identities, which necessarily involves allowing external influences from the world to reach them. It’s hard to find the right balance between the two sources of influence, and it seems to be becoming harder in the modern world, where there is always a screen on-hand, piping in an endless stream of potentially harmful messages.",

Recently, I picked up the January 2025 issue of [_National Geographic_](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/) from a [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/). My family used to have a subscription when I was a kid, and I must have flipped through dozens of issues. It’s nice to see that the magazine has endured, in much the same form as I remember.\n\nLet me give a quick rundown what I found interesting in this issue:\n\n- The wreckage of the [_Endurance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_%281912_ship%29) has been discovered under the Antarctic ice. The ship sank in 1915 during a legendary expedition, and the mission to find the wreck, even aided by modern technology like sonar and underwater drones, was just as difficult as the original voyage.\n\n- All tea leaves come from the same species of plant, [_Camellia sinensis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis). I always thought that the many varieties of tea—e.g. green tea, oolong, pu’er—were taken from different plants, but it turns out they are all the same leaf, just processed in different ways. [Pu’er](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu'er_tea), the subject of this particular article, can be fermented for up to 10 years or more. On Jingmai Mountain in China, a small indigenous community has been farming an ancient forest for centuries.\n\n- In New Zealand, there’s a [conservation project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_Free_2050) underway to eradicate invasive predators (rats, possums, stoats, etc.), in order to protect the native bird species, like the iconic kiwi. At first glance, it seems brutal and violent to kill millions of animals, but the sad fact is that they should never have been there, since they were brought in by settlers coming from overseas[^nat-geo-jan-1]. The article describes some cool technological advances—e.g. self-loading traps, computer-aided visual identification of predators—that have helped the project along.\n\n[^nat-geo-jan-1]: We’ve been playing a board game called [_Spirit Island_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island), for which the theme is to defend an island against (human) invaders. It has put me in a mindset that has made it easier to understand the rationale for eradication, as unpleasant as it may sound.",

They got together when she was 17 and he was 47, and stayed together until he passed away in his 90’s. \n\nAt the core of the book are the questions:\n\n> Does a story's ending excuse its beginning?\n> […]\n> Can a love that starts with such an asymmetrical balance of power ever right itself?\n\nI don’t think it’s a conflict that can be resolved: her and her husband’s long-lasting love was genuine, but he was her teacher and surrogate father figure when they met, which is indisputably icky. Through her writing, she does a good job of expressing her doubts, while also showing that she is ultimately at peace with the relationship.\n\nMy favourite parts of the book involve her revisiting her previous memoir, [_Half a Life_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b9cc46af-d482-491a-9a47-7cbb63b5f138), which she published in the midst of their marriage. In that book, she now sees a sort of self-censorship, where she glossed over the uncomfortable truths of how they first met, and made it seem like she had made all of the advances. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything like this before, a double-layered memoir, showing in such a literal way how our recollections of the past change over time.\n\nSee also: the film [_May December_](/blog/2023/10/may-december), which covers some of same themes.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5bf9c55b-2b4b-482c-93ca-69526666e9f0)\n\n",

The fledgling Foundation faces crises, i.e. threats from other planetary civilations, but it always turns out that Hari Seldon predicted what was going to happen. When the crises are resolved, always in the Foundation’s favour, it’s revealed that it was the only way that events could have unfolded.\n\n_Foundation and Empire_ turns the idea on its head by introducing a character called “The Mule,” who conquers planets at an alarming rate, and threatens to take over the Foundation. Without spoiling too much, I’ll just say that the Mule is unique, and since Seldon’s predictions only work on broad social events, the Mule throws the preordained plan into chaos.\n\nIn contrast to the “everything always works out” ethos of the previous novel, the Mule creates real tension and suspense. We experience the story through characters who don’t know what’s going to happen next… which is basically like most stories we read, but feels refreshing in this world of predestination.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/76e1580a-ef98-42e8-a54e-365fd8735d6e)",

		"content": "This novel came to my attention during the [Booker Prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/prize-years/2024) shortlist period. On paper, it’s right up my alley—a literary novel with a space travel/sci-fi theme—and so, when it won the award, I became quite eager to get my hands on it.\n\nThe novel puts us on board the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station), along with its crew of six astronauts, as they orbit the Earth. It covers a 24-hour period, during which they go around the world 16 times. There’s no plot really, other than a growing typhoon over Asia, and the fact that another crew is launching a mission to the moon on that same day.\n\nThe prose is well-written, with many poetic turns of phrase and lyrical passages. It does a good job of evoking the hardships that the astronauts go through: their sense of time is all out of whack because they experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every “day,” and they’re fighting to keep their bodies healthy in an envirnoment that humans are not built for.\n\n> After six months in space they will, in technical terms, have aged 0.007 seconds less than someone on earth. But in other respects they'll have aged five or ten years more, and this is only in the ways they currently understand. They know that the vision can weaken and the bones deteriorate. Even with so much exercise still the muscles will atrophy. The blood will clot and the brain shift in its fluid. The spine lengthens, the T cells struggle to reproduce, kidney stones form. While they're here food tastes of little. Their sinuses are murder.\n\nBut ultimately, I was disappointed with my reading experience. I found it frustrating because there was little narrative drive for me.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI think I would be able to accept the lack of plot if the book made up for it with character development. However, I didn’t feel that there was much focus on the characters, either. We get introduced to each of the six—with some cultural markers which are, frankly, a bit on-the-nose[^orbital-1]—but in a deliberate stylistic choice (I believe), the perspective never stays on any one character for very long.\n\nThere’s a constant feeling of “zooming out”: a passage will start with the description of one of the astronauts, but will shift to the _they_ pronoun, so that it becomes about the whole crew. Furthermore, the prose will sometimes shift to a second-person _you_ perspective.\n\n> They were warned in their training about the problem of dissonance. They were warned about what would happen with repeated exposure to this seamless earth. You will see, they were told, its fullness, its absence of borders except those between land and sea. You'll see no countries, just a rolling indivisible globe which knows no possibility of separation, let alone war. And you'll feel yourself pulled in two directions at once. Exhilaration, anxiety, rapture, depression, tenderness, anger, hope, despair. Because of course you know that war abounds and that borders are something that people will kill and die for.\n\nI get the thematic reasons for these perspective shifts: the astronauts are floating above the whole world, and they represent all of humanity. Yes, _you_ too, the reader. However, since it’s constantly pulling away from the characters, I found it hard to care about any of them, and I was left with the impression that the book is all theme, and no story.\n\n[^orbital-1]: The Russian one has a beef against America. The Italian one tries to add garlic to the pre-processed space food. The Japanese one has family members who barely survived the nuclear bombs in WWII.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0b4ed4f5-8186-4d33-a91f-cea964c8c949)",

In the show, Goku and friends are transformed into children, and must adventure through the “demon realm” to restore their normal bodies and defeat the demon king.\n\nI don’t really have much to say about it… it’s mostly mindless action. It seems that the animation quality is more consistent than I remember of the other shows, probably because it’s a limited run. I’m not a huge fan of having the characters be children, though… it feels like a way to increase the cuteness quotient of the whole thing, but doesn’t serve any story purpose.\n\nAnyway, I’ll always get a kick out of it whenever one of our heroes powers up and shows off a new fighting technique or a transformation.

		"content": "I had a good time with this horror thriller, especially for the first two-thirds. The performances from the trio of lead actors are all impressive, and the characters’ respective stances on religion are all well-represented. On the downside, the villain’s plot suffers from being overly convoluted—it’s a long walk just to make a philosophical point.\n\nThere’s a point that I want to think through, which will require spoilers, so stop reading if you don’t want to know.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nNear the beginning of the movie, Sister Paxton says that she wishes to come back as a butterfly when she dies, so that she can visit her loved ones. I immediately wondered whether reincarnation was part of the Mormon belief system (it isn’t), and I assumed Mr. Reed would call her out on it, as part of his attack on religion—he would say: if her beliefs don’t even line up with the dogma of her church, how can she call herself a representative of her faith? But he doesn’t bring it up, and later, it becomes a poignant emotional moment at the end, when she sees a butterfly after her partner, Sister Barnes, is killed.\n\nFor a movie that’s so concerned with a rigorous debate about religion, I don’t think that the writers would have made this oversight. So I choose to conclude that Sister Paxton’s heretical belief in reincarnation is an intentional statement about how people engage with their faiths.\n\nRegrettably, there was a time in my life where I would have picked on any inconsistency in a person’s faith, and used it as “proof” that religion is illogical and therefore invalid. But I’ve learned over the years that religions aren’t monoliths: their followers can accept and reject parts of their teachings, and that’s okay. Whatever people believe in, it’s just a part of their complex whole being, and acceptance should be the default position for everyone, whether or not they’re religious.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/heretic-2024/)",

		"content": "Previously: [1](/blog/2024/11/prelude-to-foundation) [2](/blog/2024/12/forward-the-foundation)\n\nI’m really hesitant to say it, but I didn’t really enjoy this one… of course it’s revered as a classic and I don’t doubt that it deserves it, but could it be that its stature is due to the strength of the series that it started, rather than its own merit?\n\nA big part of the problem for me is the way that the story is told mainly through dialogue. Almost every scene involves a few people in a room, talking about grand abstract political or sociological ideas. There’s very little shown of how the various crises play out on the ground.\n\nWhat does work are the ideas themselves: it is a fascinating bird’s-eye view of how a future civilization would develop over time. At first, the Foundation is set up to create a compendium of knowledge called the Encyclopedia Galactica, but it turns out this goal is simply the means to another end: namely, to give a reason for a small colony of scientifically-minded people to grow and thrive. Inevitably, they run up against the forces of surrounding planets, and they have to use unconventional (i.e. non-military) methods to continue as a society, including the creation of a religion based on the seeming magic of atomic power; and later, the use of economic trade to control their adversaries. In both cases, it’s their superior technology that allows them to win; the story’s conceit is that because the Foundation started as an academic endeavour, it allowed them to have the intellectual resources to develop said technology.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn’t until I wrote out that last paragraph that the chain of cause and effect actually clicked for me. During my time reading it, I found it hard to follow because it’s told at such a distance, with characters that are more mouthpieces than people. The two prequel novels that I’ve already read managed to balance the sociological concepts with adventure and character, so I think that Asimov’s skill as a storyteller improved as his career went on.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e076391b-0215-46a0-826d-318918fef86e)",

Watching it now, I think I can see why… back then, I would have thought it was the coolest thing, when they introduce characters with a freeze-frame showing their name on the screen. And the scene where our main characters walk as a group in slow motion and glare smolderingly at all of the other students who have been taken over by aliens… _so cool_.\n\nThe way this film depicts high school students was exactly my image of what it meant to be cool when I was that age: be angry and swear all the time, and talk to teachers with no respect! And fighting off an alien invasion was exactly the kind of thing that I fantasized about as a kid.\n\nHow does it hold up? I think it’s still entertaining. And I couldn’t believe who was in the cast… Jon Stewart? Salma Hayek, who appears in only a couple of scenes? Daniel von Bargen, a.k.a. Mr. Kruger of Kruger Industrial Smoothing on _Seinfeld_?\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-faculty/)",

		"content": "The characters in this Korean supernatural thriller include a professional shaman and a geomancer. The former performs rituals that exorcise bad spirits and the latter is a specialist in finding the most auspicious plots in which to bury the dead. I got a kick especially from the film’s depiction of the rituals, which involve elaborate dances and musical chanting. On the other hand, I was left asking at several points, if they’re such experts and professionals, why are they doing the thing that will obviously lead to having a curse descend on them? Just leave that mysterious gravesite alone!\n\nWhen the bad spirits are released, it leads to some effective scary scenes, where the ghost only appears fuzzily in the mirror. I did have some trouble following exactly what was going on sometimes, but that may be because of some specific Korean mythology that I don’t know much about.\n\nUltimately, the movie has an interesting message about the identity of the Korean people, and the long historical relationship between Japan and Korea. I don’t think I felt it, but I’m sure it would hit native viewers much more.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/exhuma/)",

		"content": "Set in a remote snowbound Polish village, this novel was a fitting read for the type of winter we’re having this year. The protagonist and narrator, Mrs. Duszejko, lives mostly in isolation. Most of the residents only spend their summers there, and she’s one of a handful of people who brave the cold over the winter.\n\nThe plot kicks off with her and her neighbour discovering the dead body of another neighbour, who had choked on a bone while eating. Soon, other villagers are found dead in increasingly bizarre circumstances. The book is sold as a crime/mystery novel, but it didn’t feel like that to me. Instead, the focus is on Mrs. Duszejko’s inner life.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI had a really hard time pinning down Mrs. Duszejko’s character, and I mean that as a compliment to the novel. She’s motivated mainly by her love for animals, which is something that I can get behind, but she expresses it by antagonizing the other townspeople, going on rants at the police station and accusing hunters of illegal poaching. She believes strongly in astrology; I tend to look down on pseudoscience, but her practice of it seems harmless, except for the fact that she pushes it on her friends.\n\nOn top of it all, I was left wondering if she suffers from mental illness. She has visions of her dead mother and grandmother, and most heartbreakingly, bursts into tears at random times, believing that it’s some sort of physical “ailment.” The narration (i.e. her internal monologue) descends into dark feelings that she’s useless or has no purpose.\n\nI didn’t always enjoy my reading experience, as it’s sometimes meandering and slow. But in the end, I appreciated what the book was doing. It’s a portrait of a complicated person, whose sense of morality is in the right place, even if she doesn’t know what to do about it. You may not alway like her, but you can relate to her.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/edff6c15-3e68-40b8-bc88-799604bfff2a)",

		"content": "After being [blown away by _The First Omen_](/blog/2024/10/halloween-binge), I just had to go back and check out the original film that launched the franchise. I guess it’s considered a horror classic, but I had never seen it before.\n\nSurprisingly, the movie made me laugh a lot. I mean no disrespect; I would characterize it more as “laughing _with_” than “laughing _at_,” even though I’m sure the filmmakers didn’t intend to produce a comedy. I laughed because I was charmed… movies have evolved since the 70’s, and the rhythms and beats that were used to create suspense back then now seem over-the-top. Compared to horror movies today, everything—the acting, editing, sound—feels slower, but _bigger_, more theatrical. Especially notable was the score, which was not subtle at all, transitioning from idyllic melodies into _Psycho_-esque [stings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun_dun_duuun!) at the drop of a hat.\n\nAgain, that’s not to say that I didn’t like it. I enjoyed the ride. With older films, since they didn’t have the ability to cram special effects into every other scene, the handful of _wow_ moments really stand out. I also got a kick out of learning the context of the references in _The First Omen_. I look forward to a future double feature, watching the two back-to-back.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-omen/)",

		"content": "[I started last year](/blog/2024/01/humankind) with an optimistic non-fiction read, and coincidentally, I recently finished another book with a similar tone, in Hannah Ritchie’s _Not the End of the World_. It feels right to start the year in a hopeful mood, so maybe this will become a quasi-New Year’s Resolution for me going forward.\n\nRitchie’s book uses a data-driven approach to examine the threats of climate change. She’s the lead researcher for the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and as summarized by one of the articles published there, the book asks us to hold three truths at the same time: [“The world is much better; the world is still awful; the world can do much better.”](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) It’s easy to get gloomy and focus on the latter two parts of that statement, but this book tries to shine a light on the first, and I appreciated the boost of optimism that it gave me.\n\nPart of Ritchie’s goal is to “sort” the issues by the impact that they have, in a quantitative way. Environmentally conscious people like myself tend to worry about many different things, and feel guilty about every action that may harm the planet. But if you look at the data, some things matter more than others.\n\nFor example, [palm oil](https://ourworldindata.org/palm-oil) and [plastic packaging](https://ourworldindata.org/faq-on-plastics#are-plastic-alternatives-better-for-the-environment) get a bad rap, but their impact is small, and the alternatives may actually be more harmful. (Other oil crops require more land to grow; and _not_ packaging food would lead to more waste.) Conversely, the most impactful actions include: reducing beef and dairy consumption, driving an electric car (or driving less altogether), and of course, transitioning off the burning of fossil fuels for energy.\n\nRitchie sums up her ideas in a [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3VVrggKz4) of [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XNQFqUwCnU) online. Definitely bookmark-worthy, and if I’m ever in a hopeless mood, she will serve as a reminder that there is positive change happening, and a path forward.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/dbc08d80-243e-47e2-bbeb-4225882e303e)",

		"content": "Another entry in the TIFF Secret Movie Club series, this film was an enjoyable rom-com about a gay Indian man who brings a boyfriend to meet his traditional parents for the first time. We hit most of the beats of the rom-com formula: the meet-cute, the big fight and temporary break-up, the grand gesture to get back together (although I felt that this scene was missing an actual apology and acknowledgement of wrongdoing), and of course, the happy ending.\n\nInterestingly, there’s no coming out scene: the main character’s family knows that he’s gay from the get-go. But they’ve never seen him be with someone, and the difference between being accepting _in theory_, and being comfortable _in practice_, is one of the main themes of the movie.\n\nI had a lot of laughs watching this and it was a good time. After the film, the lead actor and the director held a Q&A session over Zoom. It turns out that they’re a couple in real life, and they were able to express how personal the film was for them, which really enriched the experience for me.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-nice-indian-boy/)",

		"content": "I recently caught up with the second season of _Pachinko_. The show follows the lives of a Korean family living in Japan, spanning from the 1930’s, when the main character, Sunja, was a young woman, all the way to the 1980’s, when she is a grandmother, and her grandson Solomon becomes the protagonist.\n\nOne of the main challenges that the entire family encounters is the discrimination that they face as a minority group, and it’s a fascinating to see how little this problem improves despite the decades of progress that has shaped the world around them. Somehow, they survive and thrive, but they end up going through life with a chip on their shoulder. Solomon, especially, uses his profession as a high-flying finance guy to make [_Succession_](/blog/2024/02/succession)-style deals and enact revenge against perceived cultural insults. It’s as if he’s getting back at all Japanese people for how they’ve treated his family through the years.\n\nKudos to the cast, who perform in both Japanese and Korean (and sometimes English). Not easy languages to learn, I’m sure. Speaking of the cast, though, one flaw that I see with the production of the show is that they don’t seem to age enough. The same actress plays Sunja from 1930-something, all the way to 1950, and she looks pretty much the same throughout. By the end of the season, one of her sons is a young man, and the two of them look like they’re the same age, which does make some dramatic scenes less convincing.\n\nI’ll shout out one sequence in particular, where one of the characters lives through the nuclear bombing in Nagasaki. The blast itself is depicted only as a bright light, but the scenes covering the days before the explosion build tension in a cool way, by showing the date in big lettering on the screen. To emphasize the point, there are also conspicuously visible calendars on the wall in the background. It was a very effective way of building suspense.\n\nLike many Apple TV+ shows, it seems like they have spared no expense in recreating the look of multiple historical eras, and I hope that their coffers don’t run out before they can complete the story in subsequent seasons.",

		"content": "I spent a lot of time in museums when I visited London in the fall of last year. The [British Museum](https://www.britishmuseum.org/) is a gigantic repository of artifacts, which seems to cover all of human history from all over the world. It was truly overwhelming and awe-inspiring, and I came away feeling ignorant. Our world has so many stories to tell and even if I really tried, I could only hope to learn a small fraction of them.[^1]\n\nDuring the same trip, I stumbled across a copy of Andrew Marr’s _A History of the World_ in a used bookstore. Since I was feeling the urge to improve my historical education, I picked it up and started reading as soon as I came home.\n\nIt’s quite an ambitious work, to attempt to summarize world history in one book. It’s impossible, of course, but what is here is successful, I think. It reads like a series of articles, around the length that can be tackled in one sitting, each focussing on a specific event. Every once in a while, there’ll be a few pages where Marr attempts to synthesize and draw comparisons between the stories, for example, how both the Vikings and the Mongols shaped Europe via conquest. It’s all pretty readable, but since it has to cover so much ground, it does inevitably have to refer to some names that the reader is assumed to already know. A lot of times, I didn’t get the references, so had to keep Wikipedia handy.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nIf there’s a main thesis point to tie it all together, it’s the old adage that power corrupts. It can make for a bleak reading experience sometimes, as Marr recounts the brutal human costs of war and tyranny. I’ll let Marr summarize it himself:\n\n> A key theme in this history has been the mismatch between mankind's ability to understand the world and so reshape it, and on the other hand the lack of progress in how we are ruled. Science strides ahead; politics stumbles around like a drunk. We saw it in the age of discovery and the age of empire, but it was particularly glaring in the twentieth century—and, I would add (so far), the twenty-first too.\n\nFinally, I’ll point out the main flaw that I see in the book: it’s somewhat Eurocentric. It’s not surprising that the author would favour the areas of his expertise, but I found his coverage of other parts of the world to be lacking in both quantity and quality.\n\nStill, it scratched my itch to learn more about history, if only at a superficial level. I hope that I can use this as a jumping-off point and find more in-depth titles to read going forward.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/070fc68e-e6b8-47df-a23f-eda334ea4d3a)\n\n[^1]: Coincidentally, I’ve been [diving](/blog/2024/11/prelude-to-foundation) [into](/blog/2024/12/forward-the-foundation) the _Foundation_ series by Isaac Asimov, and the main character, Hari Seldon, expresses a similar feeling, but dialled up even more. If I already feel overwhelmed by the scope of history in our one world, imagine the burden of a person whose mission is to grasp the path of the Galactic Empire by studying its _25 million_ planets.",

I think I had always been curious about the series, and figured that I would read it before jumping into the show. I ended up being [disappointed](/blog/2025/01/storygraph-reviews) at how the story progressed, so I didn’t feel the need to follow the show as it aired.\n\nOn my recent trip to London, I saw an exhibit at the [Victoria & Albert Museum](https://www.vam.ac.uk/) with some [costumes](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1779672/costume-for-ruth-wilson-as-costume-mccall-caroline/) and [props](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1779677/the-alethiometer-property-collins-joel/) from the show, which reignited my interest. Even if I wasn’t fully satisfied by the books, I still enjoyed a lot of it.\n\nThe TV adaptation is so faithful that my reaction to the show pretty much mirrors how I felt about the books. The first season is the best, with a great sense of adventure and world-building, but it becomes overly convoluted by the third, final season. However, even as I lost track of the plot and character motivations, the visual depictions of fantastical beings like angels and witches and armoured bears were still pretty cool. And I like the cast, especially Dafne Keen as Lyra and Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Coulter.\n\nAll in all, I would still recommend the show if you want to see some cool magical concepts and special effects, as long as you’re prepared to be confused and frustrated by the end.\n\n[^1]: I got my hands on a copy of an omnibus version, which has the entire trilogy in one volume.

There’s a name for this approach: [POSSE, which stands for \"Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere.\"](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) It could be as simple as copy and pasting, but as a software developer, I can’t help but try to find a way to automate it.\n\nLet’s see if I get around to it...\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n----\n\n### [_Alias Grace_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1d49afcf-01ea-4ee4-9807-d9c0dee045e5) <small>by Margaret Atwood</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-04-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt was well-written and I enjoyed the narration of Grace, the main character.  But I had a problem with the character of the doctor, Simon.  It seemed like the character of Simon was meant to be a parallel to Grace, but I don't think the book spends enough time with his story to fully develop that connection.  It would have been better if the time was evenly divided between the two characters, or just focussed on Grace herself.  The chapters about Simon seemed tacked on; and I found that his subplot ended abruptly.\n\nMy favourite parts were the sections that consisted of letters between the different characters, especially the letters from Simon's mother.  She played the motherly guilt trip in a way that was real and funny.\n\n### [_The Pixar Touch: The Making of a Company_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0b1d298f-947f-4f95-8351-6d59c5d2a7f9) <small>by David A. Price</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-11-28</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThis book does a good job of balancing the three different aspects of Pixar's story.  One, the development of the technology that they use to produce computer graphics.  Two, the creative process that goes into finding and perfecting the stories and ideas in their movies.  Three, the business deals and relationships between the key players.  The book would be interesting if it was about any one of these areas; combining them together made for an entertaining and informative read.\n\n### [_Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f5d8004b-f810-4eab-9389-78de2121a5a4) <small>by Mary Roach</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2010-12-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI might have been grossed out in some parts if it hadn't been so funny...\n\n### [_Sacred Games_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/22f5244b-b876-41fc-9532-ffec23c7e8cd) <small>by Vikram Chandra</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-02-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt took me a very long time to read _Sacred Games_, and it was mostly worth it.  There are some powerful moments and I liked the overall setting and style, but it was ultimately a bit uneven.\n\nWhen I first started reading it, the language took a bit of getting used to.  Chandra uses a lot of words in various Indian languages.  Even the characters' names were hard to keep track of because they are unfamiliar.  There is a large glossary, but I found that it was too cumbersome to flip to it all the time, and it was better just to read on.  Usually the context was enough to provide understanding.\n\nStructurally, the novel is quite interesting.  Chapters alternate between focussing on Sartaj Singh, a police detective, and Ganesh Gaitonde, a crime boss.  The two characters actually meet in the first chapter and Gaitonde dies.  The rest of the Gaitonde chapters are flashbacks of his criminal \"career\" and what lead to his end, while the Sartaj chapters deal with his investigation into the same events.  Apart from this alternating series of chapters, there are occasional chapters called \"Insets\" that have to do with peripheral characters who may or may not affect the main plot.\n\nBecause of this structure, the experience is like reading two separate novels, with the Insets acting like short stories thrown into the mix.  I thought the Gaitonde story was a bit stronger than Sartaj's.  Parts of it reminded me of the De Niro parts of _The Godfather Part II_, particularly near the beginning when he is working his up the criminal hierarchy.  When he becomes the boss, his mental state often fluctuates between aggressive cockiness and paranoid insecurity.  I can imagine that the stresses of being the head of a crime organization would do that to you.\n\nOne of my favourite chapters was the Inset revolving around Sartaj's mother's childhood.  The writing style reflected a different time and conveyed a childlike perspective.  I won't spoil it, but what happens is really traumatic, while also tying into the themes of the larger plot.\n\nThe main problem I had with the book was the scale of the plot.  After finishing it, I can now see that the story comes together.  But during the course of reading it, it felt like there were many excessive diversions.  Sometimes it would tie into the plot, and sometimes not.  While I admire the richness of it, I was often left thinking to myself, \"Why is this important?\"  As an example, the penultimate chapter involves a character who has seemingly not been previously introduced.  We basically go through his entire life story before we find out that he is in fact a background character who was involved an earlier event involving one of the main characters.  The fact that this chapter takes place after the climax of the main plot made it seem really out of place and unnecessary.\n\nOverall, I liked the immersiveness of _Sacred Games_, but maybe it was so immersive that sometimes I lost track of the point.\n\n### [_Operation Mincemeat: How a Dead Man and a Bizarre Plan Fooled the Nazis and Assured an Allied Victory_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/64a3aa63-fa61-49f6-91af-b4428d1e9d52) <small>by Ben Macintyre</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-02-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe thing that struck me most while reading this was how much luck was involved in the operation's success.  It's fascinating how such an event as large-scale as the invasion of Sicily was affected by a series of small events that made Operation Mincemeat work.  Little things like finding the right photograph to match the dead body, the documents landing in the hands of an anti-Nazi German officer, etc... if any of those things had happened differently, the entire operation could have failed.  The book does a good job of revealing these turns of fortune in an entertaining way so that it reads like a suspense novel.\n\n### [_Black Hole_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/655f3acd-f1d0-43fc-9f36-872efc724d45) <small>by Charles Burns</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nOther than the gross-out factor of the effects of \"The Bug\" disease, I didn't really find it very interesting.  The story is pretty typical teenage angst stuff.\n\n### [_Blankets_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/847cffea-c929-4a60-ac59-6ee604c48cec) <small>by Craig Thompson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-07</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nImaginative drawings.  Nice story.  Sad story.\n\n### [_A Clockwork Orange_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f08c7201-78f3-4740-9373-569688dea3d4) <small>by Anthony Burgess</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"5.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nSecond time reading the book.  Have seen the movie many times.  I still find the language and voice entertaining.\n\nI believe this was the first time I've been exposed to the last chapter (older editions have the last chapter cut out, and the movie doesn't adapt the last chapter).  I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It does provide a nice symmetry to the first chapter, but I thought it was a bit too convenient.  It features a character change in Alex that seems like it's just there to make a point and to end it on a positive note.\n\n### [_Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/93a0cf6b-9cd3-4717-ac48-bcca4f25a84c) <small>by Jack Weatherford</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-04-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIn a way, the title is misleading.  I was expecting something like a biography of Genghis Khan, and it is that to start with.  I was surprised when the death of Genghis Khan occurred about a third of the way through the book.  There's a definite tonal change at this point.  The parts about Genghis's early life and eventual rise to power feel more like legends and myths because the research is drawn from stories that were probably passed down orally before being recorded historically.  After his death, the book shifts to a more high-level account of his descendants and empire.  As the empire grew, so did the number of \"proper\" historians taking down the events.  As a result, the text becomes more encyclopedic and less personal, and I found it less compelling.  Still, I learned a lot about a subject that I wasn't that familiar with before, so it's good.\n\n### [_The Monkeyface Chronicles_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f80cd1bf-8cc1-4a33-9e8e-749737dc4c9f) <small>by Richard Scarsbrook</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-06-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nVery entertaining and hard to put down.  I read the entire third act in one sitting, on the eve of Father’s Day, which is interesting considering the plot revelations that come out.\n\nIn many instances, the characters surprise you by behaving in ways you don’t expect.  Some characters are set up to be a certain way, but end up making choices that break out of what a clichéd version of the character might do.  For example, in an early scene, the principal of the school, who is also the father of the school bullies, resolves a bullying incident by favouring justice over nepotism.  It took me by surprise, and it was very satisfying.\n\nOverall, a funny and enjoyable read.\n\n### [_The Year of the Flood_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/89c1fc64-269d-477d-bda4-64a86aaab76f) <small>by Margaret Atwood</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-06-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nNot as good as _Oryx and Crake_.  I found that switching between two main characters took me out of it.  It’s a bit odd to have one of them narrated in first person, and the other in third person.  I don’t think it serves any great purpose, and it only caused me to have to adjust every time the perspective changed.\n\nMy biggest problem with it is that all the minor characters that Jimmy knew and met independently in _Oryx and Crake_ are shown to have a history together in The Year of the Flood.  It was too much of a coincidence and made it seem arbitrary.\n\n### [_A Visit from the Goon Squad_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/27a41ddd-5ed1-439d-beb4-75d54c0bd486) <small>by Jennifer Egan</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-07-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt’s appropriate that I read _Cloud Atlas_ not long ago. That novel and _A Visit from the Goon Squad_ share some similarities in structure: both are essentially a set of short stories, each in a different style, that are all connected in some way.  Ultimately, I have to say that I enjoyed _Cloud Atlas_ more than _Goon Squad_.\n\nThe main difference between the two is the purpose that the structure and style serves.  In _Cloud Atlas_, the structure made me curious as to how the stories would end up connecting to each other.  The changes in style worked because they suited the different settings of each story.\n\nIn _Goon Squad_, conversely, the structure and style work against the story.  The point-of-view change in each chapter makes it difficult to connect to any one character.  By the time you get to know a character, their story is pretty much over and we’re on to the next one.  It didn’t help that most of the characters were expressing the same dissatisfaction and sadness over getting old.  I know that aging and the passage of time are the themes of the book, but it got a little monotonous because everyone in the story is filled with angst and regret.\n\nI respect Egan’s writing style for the most part; she definitely expresses ideas very creatively.  However, I think she overdoes it in a couple of chapters.  The chapter about Rob is narrated in the second person.  I don’t think there’s any reason for it, other than to do something different.  It’s almost like she wrote it in first person and then simply replaced every “I” with “you.”  I kept forgetting that it was narrated this way and had to reorient myself every time I came across the word “you.”\n\nThe other chapter that bothered me was the PowerPoint chapter, supposedly a presentation put together by a 12-year-old girl.  It’s almost a shame because I found the girl’s autistic brother to be interesting.  The brother is obsessed with pauses in songs, and I thought it was a cool concept.  Unfortunately, that distinctive character was masked by the quirky format for the chapter.\n\nOverall, I didn’t really enjoy the book.  I admire the technique and writing style, but the lack of an end-to-end narrative and some overly gimmicky sections took me out of it.\n\n### [_A Game of Thrones_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/021b6c9c-a678-49b7-9a04-93b3c4fc56ae) <small>by George R.R. Martin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-08-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI read this after enjoying the TV series.  The book is good, but I must say the TV show does a pretty good job of covering it.  I was able to gloss over some of the more descriptive parts of the book because I had already seen the visual representation and so already had a mental image.\n\nThe real test will be when I read the next book, which I want to do before the second season of the show comes out...\n\n### [_The Cult of the Amateur_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7c523bc7-d707-44f3-883e-1ff5ae240518) <small>by Andrew Keen</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-09-22</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt was good for the first couple of chapters.  I agree that the Internet tends to glorify the participation of the masses, even if those masses produce very little quality.  Keen criticizes Wikipedia in particular, which has made me second-guess my own dependence on that site.  I’ve never used Wikipedia for any in-depth research, but I now worry that even the small factoids that I get from it may not be true.  I think that we are starting to forget the distinction between content created by experts and by amateurs, and this book does a good job reminding us of that.\n\nIn the second half, I think the book loses track of its main argument and devolves into moralizing.  It basically boils down to: “The Internet is bad because people get addicted to online poker!  And people steal music!  And there’s too much porn!”  These latter chapters seem disconnected from the original thesis of the book, since these problems aren’t related to the creation of content by amateurs.  While the first part of the book is about the objective quality of content, the second half deals with subjective morals, and it becomes too grounded in the personal values of the author.\n\nPerhaps ironically, the very act of my writing this review (I’m not a professional writer or reviewer) is exactly the kind of thing that this book is arguing against.  So I wonder, can anyone really write a review of this book without having an inherent bias?\n\n### [_A Clash of Kings_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/66465692-f355-4550-b00a-89d5de5ae396) <small>by George R.R. Martin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-10-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nSince this series of books is so plot-driven, it's hard to discuss without giving anything away.  I'll just say that I enjoyed it, and I'm looking forward to see what happens next.  I'm also very curious about how HBO is going to film this; it's bigger in scope than the first book and has more big action scenes that will be difficult to bring to the screen.  Buy the DVDs, people... they're going to need the money.\n\n### [_The Corrections_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/484fcc35-295f-46b5-b3e0-bad9b682278f) <small>by Jonathan Franzen</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2011-11-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI admired more than enjoyed this book.  It's very well-written, but underneath the impressive style are a story and characters that I didn't like very much.  I thought that it spent too much time in flashback, which gives it the feeling that the current storyline is constantly stalled; I was always waiting for it to get back to what's happening _now_.\n\n### [_The Invention of Hugo Cabret_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1a595c1e-8067-44d4-9f5a-44d06dc4603d) <small>by Brian Selznick</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-02-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe illustrations were great.  I didn't read all of the text because it's written at a very kid-friendly level and didn't interest me much.  This is one example where the movie works better than the book, mainly because I think it's very important to actually see Méliès films in motion.\n\n### [_The Sisters Brothers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8d5e30dd-f1c7-4f67-9029-e247fefa8c56) <small>by Patrick deWitt</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-06-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI don't usually like Westerns, but this was okay.  Had some good dark humour.  The writing style was nice and crisp, but I never felt any real tension in the story.\n\n### [_Oblivion: Stories_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/58bd6573-69e9-4b77-a08f-2ad0bc12b412) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-09-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\n\"Good Old Neon\" is worth the price of admission. I'm less impressed with the rest than I was the first time around.\n\n### [_Under the Banner of Heaven_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3472100c-e7d2-4dfb-8561-1b546f66e7b4) <small>by Jon Krakauer</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nA good mix of true crime and history, although I found the true crime bits overly lurid at times.  Also, by focussing so much on the fundamentalist sects of Mormonism and the very negative aspects of these sects, it might be a bit unfair to Mormonism in general.\n\n### [_Cloud Atlas_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/22fe15a2-ddc3-458f-b79c-e740fa8c3f9a) <small>by David Mitchell</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2012-10-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nMuch has been said about the structure of this novel, so I'll try to keep my thoughts on the subject to a minimum. Basically, I don't think that the structure contributes anything to the overall experience beyond providing some \"hey, cool\" moments where one story references another. Therefore, I see the novel as a set of short stories connected by some common themes rather than a single, grand narrative.  As such, each story should be judged individually.\n\nThe one strength that flows throughout the book is the use of language.  Each story takes place in a different setting and time period, which allows Mitchell the opportunity to write in different styles and voices.  I particularly liked the archaic language used in \"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\"--it was challenging but not frustratingly so.  The stories that take place in the future were not as stylistically interesting for me--I've read a lot of sci-fi and the use of invented words has become familiar.\n\n\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\" was the weakest story.  While I did enjoy the character's snarkiness and intelligence, the stakes did not stack up to the more life-and-death situations that the other stories convey.  Maybe it's meant to be a comedic touch to see a curmudgeonly old man overreacting to his plight, but I felt like it didn't fit in with the others.\n\nMy favourite story of the lot is \"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After.\"  Initially, the future-hillbilly language was hard to get into, but it grew on me.  Once I warmed up to it, the innocence of the narrator and his society became evident.  The idea of a primitive post-apocalyptic society, contrasted with the high-tech society of the Prescients, worked really well in building a sense of danger.  In a world that has already lost so much, every action that they take is amplified because of the risk of losing it all.\n\n### [_The Swerve: How the World Became Modern_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d9814d72-f8a8-4011-8155-979a38fe3824) <small>by Stephen Greenblatt</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-03-19</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI liked the parallel and contrasting histories of Ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy, and how the rise of Christianity changed everything.  But when it came to the actual ideas in Lucretius's poem and how those ideas affected the Renaissance, I felt it was kind of rushed and crammed into the final two chapters.\n\n### [_Gone Girl_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9e089cca-59c8-48b4-8703-c8d734a79fae) <small>by Gillian Flynn</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-19</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt was entertaining, but the twists took me out of it.  It got to the point where I couldn't care about the characters anymore because there's no truth to them.\n\n### [_Girl with Curious Hair_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/77029917-5473-461e-b1f0-2307c399329f) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-28</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nInteresting look at his early work and how his style developed.  My favourites were the title story and \"John Billy\", which both had bizarre narrative voices, something I tend to go for.  The final novella \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way\", I had to give up on.  It was more like an essay than a story, and seems to be exactly what Wallace was talking about when he said that everything he wrote when he was younger was him trying to prove that he was clever.\n\n### [_My Friend Dahmer_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ca4a91e5-5019-488d-8c26-91e9c8b4beb6) <small>by Derf Backderf</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-19</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nArtwork is great, but writing is so-so.

It really highlights the contradictory and absurd nature of Chinese communism.  But, appropriately, the humour goes out the window during her first-hand account of the Tiananmen Square massacre.  Those few chapters are very powerful indeed.\n\n\n### [_Consider the Lobster And Other Essays_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/084d5052-0b87-420e-b3eb-0a3cc8f09cd2) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-04-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\n\"Host\" and \"Up, Simba\" were a bit sloppy, I thought, but really enjoyed \"Authority and American Usage,\" especially the part about the pants.\n\n### [_Brief Interviews with Hideous Men_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/06a8534e-8b86-4365-9916-eee5f05d6a1d) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nWhile I don't expect much in terms of plot from DFW, these stories felt more like a series of rants than actual narratives.

I'm a student of the author's and have come to know him personally.)\n\nVery crisp read filled with characters that are easy to identify with.  The morality of the book divides the characters into haves and have-nots, and invariably it's the have-nots who find freedom from their situation, and find value in things other than... things.  Lots of hope.  Lots of humour.\n\n### [_Behind the Beautiful Forevers: Life, Death, and Hope in a Mumbai Undercity_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3e5c70fe-4896-4c06-b1f1-7574099b1bd1) <small>by Katherine Boo</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-11-29</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nNothing evokes guilt like reading about poverty on a brand-new shiny e-book gadget...\n\n### [_Monstress, Vol. 1: Awakening_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f3caa81e-c0fd-419d-9978-3fa5815d23ff) <small>by Marjorie Liu</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2017-08-21</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nArtwork is beautiful. The story seems to be mainly built upon withholding information about the history of the world, so that you want to find out more. I'm not totally invested in the story yet, but the characters are growing on me.\n\n### [_Half-Blood Blues_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2ec9fd2d-054e-4146-b63c-d5f12e3d1eea) <small>by Esi Edugyan</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe love triangle kept me engaged, even though Sid was being blindly and irrationally jealous most of the time. There are a couple of beautiful passages about what it's like to make music, and what talent and genius mean. Mostly, though, I never quite settled into the prose style: a bit repetitive at times, and forced my head voice into a mental blackface that I wasn't comfortable with.\n\n### [_On Snooker: The Game and the Characters Who Play It_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c743735d-609d-4290-821e-f291d912f6aa) <small>by Mordecai Richler</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-07</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nNot as much about snooker as I'd hoped. Lots of digressions. Still fun to read.\n\nHighlight: constant bashing of the player Stephen Lee for no apparent reason.\n\n### [_Hellgoing: Stories_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/05c9d14e-9217-4109-9601-d16370457679) <small>by Lynn Coady</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nEnjoyed the writing style all around.\n\nWill focus on my favourite story of the bunch, \"Dogs In Clothes.\" The main character reminds me of people I know, egocentric people who like to think of themselves as cultured, and are sensitive to any doubts cast on their sincerity. Yet, the character is not necessarily unlikable. You feel that she is just doing what is expected of her.\n\n### [_A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a99fc975-6ae8-419c-af5b-e83104a5781d) <small>by Dave Eggers</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-24</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI got the edition that has the \"Mistakes We Knew We Made\" appendix attached. I skipped it. I had had enough.\n\nIt worked for me for the first couple of chapters. The graphic descriptions of the mother's illness (\"podules\", \"green fluids\") were an effective, visceral way of gaining sympathy. The sympathy lasts after the parents are gone, when Dave and Toph are living in California. He says \"we are owed\" and I can give him that, even if I don't believe it. They suffered a tragedy, sure, but they're not the only ones to ever have parents die. The hubris is endearing until the sympathy wears off... by the time we get to Dave's work at the magazine and the extended \"interview\" with MTV, the overconfident tone became obnoxious to me.\n\nI'm not even mentioning the extended meta-commentary in the acknowledgements at the beginning. Not a good start for me... I was like, really? You're explaining your themes before the book starts?\n\n### [_The Windup Girl_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/572eac0c-0a69-47c0-be50-87759ac01863) <small>by Paolo Bacigalupi</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-12</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nExcessive worldbuilding... felt like all of the interesting stuff happens \"off-screen,\" at the expense of the present story.\n\n### [_The Fact of a Body: A Murder and a Memoir_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c5227675-4030-43ba-9ad3-9c1976229da3) <small>by Alex Marzano-Lesnevich</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-28</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe best parts of the book are the passages that connect the writer's life with the killer's. Taken alone, the two stories are interesting, but it's her finding meaning in the parallels between them that is truly compelling.\n\nOn a stylistic note, I wasn't a fan of everything in present tense. For a narrative that jumps around in time so much, it's hard to grasp a frame of reference if everything feels like it's happening all at once. I understand that the effect could be intentional, but it jarred me every time she used the _will_ future tense, e.g. \"five years from now, I will do so-and-so.\" But it's obviously all in the past.\n\n### [_Among Others_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/745a42b9-4f46-44e4-9d43-2ab6c9c14f91) <small>by Jo Walton</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-04-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe biggest strength of this novel is the combination of a coming-of-age story with a subtle magical world. The way that magic works, by indirect manipulation of reality, so that a spell seems to reach back in time to set up a chain of events that lead to the desired result, is fascinating. It also plays well with Mori's teenage insecurity; when she makes friends, she doesn't believe that she earned it. Even though she's a clear, natural fit in her book club, she chalks it up to a spell she cast, and agonizes over the \"ethics\" of her actions.\n\n### [_The Lathe of Heaven_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/be21c17b-5baf-4d4a-b071-908c2eb87ddd) <small>by Ursula K. Le Guin</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-04-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe story feels very disorienting, because it jumps between realities, and it's a new world that you have to get used to every time. This is intentional, of course, and effective. However, I felt the need to have some constant to hold onto, and didn't get it. The only relationship that exists throughout the story is between George and Haber. I would have liked to see some sort of evolution in this relationship, like a power struggle that goes back and forth. Instead, I felt that it was quite static: Haber always has the upper hand, and there's not much George can do about it.\n\n### [_The Postmortal_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ccd1cf85-b636-447a-bdc0-1c992b2d1c21) <small>by Drew Magary</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-05-27</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe setup and premise are interesting. At first, I got a _World War Z_ vibe because of the \"on the ground, as it happened\" style. Unfortunately, where _World War Z_ branched out into many different sources and perspectives, here, it's limited to the journal of one person. Because of this, the characters in John's life become vehicles to express how the postmortal cure would affect different slices of society.\n\nE.g.\n- The father: an older person.\n- The sister: a married person with kids.\n- The mother of John's child: a person making the decision to have kids.\n- The new girlfriend: a person making the decision to get married.\n\nNobody feels real, and their conversations often sound like philosophical debates.\n\n### [_Boxers_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cde66aec-c19a-4b08-a324-ece042ba8c7a) <small>by Gene Luen Yang</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI thought the ending was a bit rushed. There's a lot of moral ambiguity here, and I have to say I found it tough to get into because I never really wanted Bao to succeed. His rebellion is based on nationalism and exclusionary thinking, and I couldn't get behind it, even though on a personal level, I respect that he was trying to protect his way of life.\n\nThe artwork is great, and I enjoyed the designs of the gods that the fighters become.\n\n### [_Saints_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/01407a14-a384-4334-b961-176821102066) <small>by Gene Luen Yang</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe biggest wow moment for me was seeing the Righteous and Harmonious Fists in battle from Vibiana's perspective. They appear as men, and not as gods. It creates the sense that the Fist members are driven by faith in their cause (which I never totally agreed with while reading _Boxers_).\n\nI was not a fan of the epilogue here... I didn't think that Bao deserved to survive, and especially not due to the prayer that he learned from the girl that he murdered. I didn't feel it was just; Bao was the instigator of violence, and he ends up being victorious, in a way.\n\n### [_Outline_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2cd27b56-150a-4a99-9ad6-eac9e85ce076) <small>by Rachel Cusk</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-12</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"5.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI read this while going through a bit of a mid-life crisis. Basically, coming to the realization that it's impossible to have it all. Trying to fit everything into this life only leads to anxiety.\n\nIn this book, one character after another pours their heart out to the narrator. They reflect upon their lives, often filled with regret. On the surface, it seems like they regret their failure to attain everything they wanted. But in my state of mind, I interpreted it as regret that they failed to recognize the impossibility of attaining everything they wanted. Or, they failed to recognize that they were being told to want the wrong things.\n\nThis book is filled with passages that describe parts of my life perfectly. One of the most emotionally satisfying reads I've had in a while.\n\n### [_Beyond Measure: The Big Impact of Small Changes_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ebc3e612-3a23-4116-8a02-d7d957e19a37) <small>by Margaret Heffernan</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-22</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nMost of it seems common-sense to me: communicate, be social, be open-minded, no hierarchies. I disagree with the pitch that anyone \"from the CEO to the janitor\" can implement these changes. You still need some power to put things in motion.\n\n### [_Why We Work_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/dd41e86f-3b82-4516-b90d-b46058ad1455) <small>by Barry Schwartz</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-08-27</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe core message of the book--that people are motivated by doing work that they find meaningful--didn't seem that insightful to me. But I did like the latter half of the book, which talks about how misconceptions spread. Ideology propagates because of self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n### [_His Dark Materials_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ea810e70-f3f9-4b46-9c3a-5a3fadf7af97) <small>by Philip Pullman</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI liked it less and less as it went on. The first book, I was in, because it focused on one character's quest, and had a sense of discovery as Lyra learned about the rules of the world. There are many strange mysteries, and they all tie into her quest.\n\nBy the third book, the world-building and multiple plotlines have gotten so complex that it feels like the characters need to explain what's going on to each other in every other chapter. Lyra spends a third of it asleep, and she's the only character I ever really cared about. (Will is okay, but too brooding.) I found myself rushing through whole sequences, just to get back to her story.\n\nSome subplots I found unsatisfying:\n- The war against the Authority doesn't amount to much. We simply haven't seen the Authority do anything to make us want him to lose.\n- The assassin sent to kill Mary because she was going to tempt Lyra... he gets killed without the confrontation ever happening.\n\n### [_How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/94ecd827-f0e4-4876-9db5-40c414e039cc) <small>by Jenny Odell</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nIt was well-written and interesting, but focussed too much on art history and literary history, and didn't actually spend a lot of time on the concept of the attention economy itself. I was hoping for more social, technological and historic context.\n\n\n### [_The Elements of Typographic Style_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/da9b75f4-f637-4159-8d07-5ee1c9818606) <small>by Robert Bringhurst</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-10-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nDrew me into a world that I know nothing of, and made me feel like an expert.\n\n### [_Transit_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/50931970-8117-4b8b-8b16-031879038092) <small>by Rachel Cusk</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-10-30</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI didn't identify with this as much as I did _Outline_, but if I ever get divorced, I'll know to revisit this.\n\n### [_Kudos_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3068995f-1ebc-4908-b8c7-433c8db587ac) <small>by Rachel Cusk</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-11-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe best parts for me were those that explored the way that people (families, couples) perform happiness or unity for the sake of others. And then those other people respond with envy, until it breaks down, either because the happiness dissolves for real, or because the envious person realizes that it's only an image.\n\nI didn't like it as much when it dove too deeply into what I would call \"writer stuff\" - philosophical discussions about the value of literature and writing. It's too self-referential for me.\n\n### [_The New York Trilogy: City of Glass / Ghosts / The Locked Room_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/30ea8154-1db9-4c51-a3a0-5a1a761f5205) <small>by Paul Auster</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-12-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe linguistic theory stuff in _City of Glass_ reminded me of _Snow Crash_, which is always a good thing. _Ghosts_ was a bit weaker, and felt like a variation of the same themes. But _The Locked Room_ brought it around for me again, by bringing the more abstract ideas of the others into a more personal story.\n\nWe become our obsessions, and if our obsession is another person, we risk losing our identity.\n\n### [_The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9d11e1dc-c921-4d65-a801-f20e94504539) <small>by Cailin O'Connor, James Owen Weatherall</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-12-22</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nMore scientific than I expected, as it explains the spread of information and misinformation through precise models. Learned a lot. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there's any way out of the situation unless systems (even the very idea of democracy) fundamentally change. I'm not very hopeful about this; people won't change for the sake of it, unless there are incentives to do so.\n\n### [_The Geography of Bliss: One Grump's Search for the Happiest Places in the World_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/97341e46-a5a6-4be2-99c2-002a9631a8dd) <small>by Eric Weiner</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-01-22</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nEntertaining, but didn't give me enough insight to keep me going.\n\n### [_The Undoing Project_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3ecddd9a-2400-4d8d-b90c-650a6a6c813d) <small>by Michael Lewis</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-03-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nReally indulgent first chapter about NBA drafts, which was interesting, but had little to do with the rest of the book. I was most interested in the story of Amos and Danny's relationship, and I almost think the book could have been entirely about that.\n\n### [_Embassytown_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2edc5660-eda1-4d64-9de4-a4ad2b45573a) <small>by China Miéville</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-03-04</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nWorld-building in the first third really drew me in. Felt like a less-pristine _Star Trek_ episode. I thought the main conflict, once it started, dragged on a little. Character motivations didn't feel strongly defined.\n\n### [_Ru_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3252a994-74ad-45eb-a7f2-3f9caef9eea0) <small>by Kim Thúy</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-03-13</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI admire the writing. It's filled with both beautiful and horrific images, sometimes stacked together. (E.g., description of grandmother in beautiful dress, at peaceful Buddhist altar; then, the suggestion that the incense blunts the pain that she feels about her departed son.)\n\nOn the other hand, I think the lack of structure put me off. I didn't feel attached to any characters because they come and go so quickly that they leave only impressions.\n\n### [_Norwegian Wood_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9a8ba591-4e66-4d51-8f46-df5ba1b42711) <small>by Haruki Murakami</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-03-17</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nNot really digging the main character.

Unfortunately, the book is happy to keep him in the background as a mysterious figure, so I lost patience with it.\n\n### [_A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9864cccb-8598-481a-9a20-677db0336d4e) <small>by David Foster Wallace</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-05-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe title essay is brilliant and hilarious.  I have tried to read Wallace's fiction before and always found it a bit depressing.  I think his nonfiction is more grounded in reality and there doesn't go to the same dark places that his fiction does.  I got to appreciate his style more, and I think this will encourage me to revisit his other books.\n\n### [_Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7afddb73-0d19-4698-9047-0b7572fffccc) <small>by Douglas R. Hofstadter</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-06-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nTowards the end, as the book explores concepts from AI, I lost a bit of interest because I had doubts about whether it's out-dated. AI has progressed greatly since this book was written.\n\nBut the first half, leading up to the explanation of Godel's theorem, I found fascinating.\n\n### [_Half of a Yellow Sun_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/25c7a25c-49af-447c-a7f3-6368b7e98718) <small>by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-07-27</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI was affected more by the large-scale tragedy than by any of the personal suffering of the main characters. The final personal loss did not hit me very hard because I was already numbed by the descriptions of the horrors happening to secondary and background characters, like the beheaded servant, or the malnourished children.\n\nThroughout, I had the sense that the main characters were a bit contrived to be in an optimal position to cover all aspects of the war. For example, Olanna happens to have an ex from the north, who ends up on the opposite side of the war.\n\nThe Part 3 section was particularly jarring, an extended flashback focusing on soap opera-like subplots, which interrupts the story of the war.\n\nAll in all, despite the flaws in characterization, it was still a powerful account of a period of history that I was ignorant about.\n\n### [_Collaborating with the Enemy: How to Work with People You Don't Agree with or Like or Trust_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0defa2c9-0a38-4df3-a7af-cf9123163b7d) <small>by Adam Kahane</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-08-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt's simultaneously too long and too short. Too long because it repeats vague descriptions of its ideas multiple times, and too short because it illustrates those ideas with superficial anecdotes. I would have liked to read more about the author's experiences in how he applied these ideas.\n\n### [_Things Fall Apart_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/086e5267-9cfd-4e3a-b8fb-ed04de288ed7) <small>by Chinua Achebe</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-08-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nMy favourite little bit is when Okonkwo's daughter is taken by the priestess for some ritual, and Okonkwo desperately wants to go after her and make sure she's okay, but forces himself to wait a \"manly\" amount of time before going. Nice dig at male insecurity.\n\n### [_Women Talking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0d273abe-3dfd-43f5-ae72-0b1852fe56bf) <small>by Miriam Toews</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2020-11-24</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nDo we romanticize the Mennonite and Amish lifestyles because they live in simpler times?

Best read in small chunks.\n\n### [_Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3d322dac-adf9-4505-9113-8d66a502e9a7) <small>by Trevor Noah</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-09-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI picked up this book after my company hired him to do an interview with our CEO, and I was struck by his charisma. His charm comes through in the book, making it an easy read, but he also deals with South Africa's dark history of racism in a refreshingly blunt way.\n\nBeyond the impact of racism, there's also the huge personal cost of not fitting in with any particular group. He's not Black (though he identifies himself as such), he's not white, and that's hard enough. But there's also the colored people who are the result of race-mixing long ago, before it was illegal. He doesn't fit in with them either, even though he looks like them.\n\n### [_The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/53a9fa18-3c08-48e8-8ee6-42474477ccdd) <small>by Haruki Murakami</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-10-12</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nI enjoyed bits of the story, but I don't feel like there's a narrative that drives me to keep reading. In particular, the part about the Lieutenant's war experience in Mongolia was harrowing, and there was a realistic and sensitive discussion on abortion with the wife.\n\nI was also weirded out by some of the sexual stuff... the Creta Kano character is objectified, either as a rape victim or as the subject of wet dreams.\n\n### [_The Secret to Superhuman Strength_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9d84cbac-4bce-47a8-916e-b37f0b3fbf44) <small>by Alison Bechdel</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-10-17</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nI could have done without the repeated references to historical Transcendentalists. It would have left a more focussed look at her personal life. I was blown away by _Fun Home_, but this one didn’t hit as hard.\n\n### [_Piranesi_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a4f97770-d661-4687-944e-89e02077190d) <small>by Susanna Clarke</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-11-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nReminded me a bit of _Flowers for Algernon_ or _The Curious Incident of Dog in Night-time_, due to the narrator’s voice. He’s a naive mind who doesn’t understand the world around him, but cares greatly about being good. Combine that with a cool magical setting, and I was hooked.\n\n### [_Two Trees Make a Forest: Travels Among Taiwan's Mountains & Coasts in Search of My Family's Past_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/24acb2e2-070e-4e99-aeeb-b7428494bf0c) <small>by Jessica J. Lee</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-11-06</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nIt was too much description of scenery and geography, and not enough stories about people. Well-written, but I’m drawn more to the human element, which was lacking here.\n\n### [_This Is the Voice_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ca8ccff9-b700-4a72-890d-b520da659a33) <small>by John Colapinto</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-11-15</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nReads like a series of “did you know” factoids. Interesting but I don’t feel it has enough depth.\n\n### [_On Animals_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b1b032f9-9be1-42cd-8535-ab7b9dbb4631) <small>by Susan Orlean</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe \"Free Willy\" one was my favourite. It’s disturbing to me that hype around a movie can move so many people to act, without regard to whether it’s really best for the animal.\n\n### [_Gravity's Rainbow_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/98d29db5-5e25-4909-b574-5623778a8b32) <small>by Thomas Pynchon</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-02</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nThis was probably my third attempt. I admire it but don't enjoy it.\n\n\n### [_Seek You: A Journey Through American Loneliness_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c10d33f5-cb03-40c8-a784-783cf116540a) <small>by Kristen Radtke</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nOverall, this book contained a lot of insights about the biological and evolutionary reasons behind human psychology. There's one section, about the US gun problem, which seemed a bit off-topic to me, because it doesn't relate to the main theme of loneliness. It's kind of sad, that the gun issue is so ingrained in American culture that it just has to be commented on.\n\n### [_In the Beginning... Was the Command Line_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0f4ec0a5-cf4c-49ff-99e4-6d1a962b5099) <small>by Neal Stephenson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nPicked this up for the first time in ~20 years. I read this many times at an impressionable age, and I credit it for influencing me to start the career path that I'm still on, and further, influencing me to be the type of computer user that I am (a Morlock, in the book's terms). I've internalized so much of the book that I don't feel like I'm really _reading_ it anymore... it's more like, I'm watching sentences go by that are already in my head.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some sections that rub me the wrong way now. There's an attitude of elitism that doesn't feel right for me. I know that I was full of conceit and superiority when I was younger, so it would have appealed to me then, but it's kind of abrasive now.\n\n### [_Do Not Say We Have Nothing_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8fb7a723-fa55-4b4d-8575-f22027a3bbe0) <small>by Madeleine Thien</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2021-12-21</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nHad a hard time with the writing style. It felt quite stilted and didn't grip me emotionally. Too many characters introduced too quickly and they didn't feel like real people.\n\n### [_The Year of Magical Thinking_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/41e98516-d52e-42b0-8dd9-ee93be8534dc) <small>by Joan Didion</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-02-23</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nToo sad\n\n### [_A Canticle for Leibowitz_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/320ce5cf-e8ae-42e4-a81d-867d531318e6) <small>by Walter M. Miller Jr.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-02-23</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nInteresting concepts, but it was too distant from the characters.\n\n### [_Little Blue Encyclopedia (for Vivian)_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/28c70765-7b7c-4b11-b59b-cdc13e37b5ee) <small>by Hazel Jane Plante</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-03-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nA highlight for me in the _Little Blue_ sections was all of the invented titles of other movies or songs.\n\n### [_Dept. of Speculation_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a076c99b-6a76-4a78-a02a-20cec3fcff67) <small>by Jenny Offill</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-06-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nReally liked it until <span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">the husband's infidelity</span>. After that point, it got a little chaotic, which I guess is part of the point.\n\n### [_Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/99c9b0f6-04ac-4e76-a10a-d273468caaa2) <small>by Sam Harris</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-07-12</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nA bit too meandering in getting to its point\n\n### [_Snow Crash_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/af1e9753-9c7c-4d53-9381-bb0c57f51786) <small>by Neal Stephenson</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-07-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"5.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nAn old favourite. This time around, I found myself getting impatient towards the latter half. The first act setup is probably my favourite part, how it creates the setting and introduces the concepts of the Metaverse. As a software guy, I love that \"hacking\" is like a superpower in the book. Once we get into the long discussions with the Librarian, I started skimming.\n\n### [_The Only Good Indians_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/79437676-42a1-4936-86ac-b885a7f33ac9) <small>by Stephen Graham Jones</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-09-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nStylistically, it can be a bit hard to follow, but the story is strong and propulsive. The characters are haunted by past actions that are so specific to their culture that at first, I didn't think that what they did was a big deal. But the journey to understanding why it was a big deal for them is exactly why I love reading.\n\n### [_Escape into Meaning: Essays on Superman, Public Benches, and Other Obsessions_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ab30d8cc-c4c8-4776-bc23-3dff690587d4) <small>by Evan Puschak</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2022-09-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI’ve watched so much [Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/user/Nerdwriter1) that I heard his voice the whole time I was reading this book.\n\n### [_Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7be59bb4-a32b-4a3d-8a2e-041c1fb95b8c) <small>by Annie Dillard</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2023-04-03</small>\n\n_did not finish_\n\nI really respect the writing here, but about halfway through, I felt it was getting repetitive.\n\n### [_Version Control_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4b7b5ca6-9939-4022-a95d-288ee150ee65) <small>by Dexter Palmer</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2023-04-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt's a bit overstuffed, going on a lot of tangents about technology, e.g. social media, online dating, deepfakes/AI. It's all very insightful, but it does distract from the core of the story.",

		"content": "I guess it’s becoming a bit of a New Year’s mini-resolution for me to liberate myself from tech platforms (see [Quoteshelf](/blog/2025/01/quoteshelf)). Not that I have anything against the platforms in question, but [it’s always been important to me](/blog/2022/01/revive-again) to avoid getting locked into someone else’s website.\n\nSince 2009, the first time I attended [TIFF](/blog/tag/tiff), I’ve been tracking every movie I watch. I think I used to do it on the venerable [IMDB](https://imdb.com), but once [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) came along, I migrated over and never looked back.\n\nA social site like Letterboxd encourages a certain style of writing: pithy and snarky, i.e. like a tweet. I’ve written my fair share of those, with longer reviews residing on my blog. Having my content in two different places just sticks in my craw, so I’ve finally done the somewhat tedious work to export my posts, and have collected them all here in this post.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n----\n\n### [_Upstream Color_](https://letterboxd.com/film/upstream-color/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nParasitic worms.  Psychic pigs.  This movie has it all.\n\n### [_Room 237_](https://letterboxd.com/film/room-237/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nFun way to geek out about The Shining.  I wish the different theories were presented in a more organized way, though.\n\n### [_Barry Lyndon_](https://letterboxd.com/film/barry-lyndon/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-12</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nMust admit I have a hard time staying interested in the story, but cinematography is amazing.\n\n### [_The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-13</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nLoved the Gollum scenes, disappointed with most everything else.\n\n### [_Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-24</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nHell of a thing, when Spock died...\n\n### [_12 Angry Men_](https://letterboxd.com/film/12-angry-men/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-05-29</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nMakes me want to get picked for jury duty.\n\n### [_Summer Wars_](https://letterboxd.com/film/summer-wars/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-07</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nA great combination of techno-thriller and family drama.  I enjoyed the characters so much that I didn't care how convenient it was that everyone involved in the OZ crisis happens to be in the same family.  Also enjoyed the climactic battle, which threw in (in a self-aware way, I believe) a lot of old anime tropes, e.g. power-up transformation (with wings!), final dramatic super-move (slamming down a playing card!)\n\n### [_Premium Rush_](https://letterboxd.com/film/premium-rush/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-11</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nSo but why no brakes??\n\n### [_Star Trek: The Motion Picture_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-the-motion-picture/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-21</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nNever watched this all the way through before, despite my general Trekkiness.  I could tell that they were going for a _2001_ vibe with the deliberate pacing, but the effect is that it feels like a one-hour episode of the show stretched into a two-hour movie.  I was particularly bewildered at the Enterprise \"intro scene\" where Kirk and Scotty fly up to and dock with the ship in a shuttle... it seems to last 10 minutes, the theme song blaring in a loop the whole time.\n\n### [_Star Trek V: The Final Frontier_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-v-the-final-frontier/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-06-24</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe resolution is unsatisfying, but I thought this had the best Kirk-Spock-Bones bantering of the series... especially the campfire scene.\n\n### [_Star Trek: Generations_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-generations/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nData's whole thing with the emotion chip was so out of place.  Why would it even be okay for him to install it right in the middle of a critical mission?  And then he just spends the rest of the movie being a total goof.\n\n### [_Star Trek: First Contact_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-trek-first-contact/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-07-04</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt's the best one, plain and simple.\n\n### [_The Grandmaster_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-grandmaster/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2013-09-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nBeautiful action scenes, but I had a lot of problems with the narrative: too much voiceover and text cards, and the sequencing seemed off. Apparently, these issues exist only in the US edit, so I'm very curious to see the original Chinese cut.\n\n### [_Godzilla_](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-2014/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-06-30</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nSome great imagery. Wish they had spent more time on Godzilla; he seemed to be always in the background.\n\n### [_Brief Interviews with Hideous Men_](https://letterboxd.com/film/brief-interviews-with-hideous-men/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt was nice at least to hear DFW's writing spoken as dialogue by great actors (although Krasinski's own scene was a bit lacking); but the film wasn't quite cohesive as a whole.  I felt the same way about the book.\n\n### [_Short Term 12_](https://letterboxd.com/film/short-term-12-2013/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2014-08-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe scene were Jayden tells the octopus story was quite powerful.  Even though it wasn't clear what the octopus and the shark in the story stood for as she was telling it, the performances were so good that all it mattered was what it meant to both the characters on screen.\n\n### [_Son of Saul_](https://letterboxd.com/film/son-of-saul/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe visual strategy of this film was clear from the opening scene: a long extended take, framed as a close-up of the main character, Saul, as he corrals a frightened group of concentration camp prisoners into a gas chamber. He has a stoney expression on his face, and the viewer sees the background only on the edges of the screen, out of focus. I would estimate that 80 - 90% of the film's running time is shot this way, and it serves to put the viewer inside Saul's head. Saul is forcing himself to ignore what he's experiencing because that's the only way he can stay sane, and he gives himself a single-minded goal, to bury the body of a boy, in order to block out the chaos going on around him. As a viewer, you catch glimpses of the horrifying acts of violence happening in the background, as if the film is making you ignore them just like Saul is trying to. But at the same time, the fact that the images are out of focus forces you to look closely, to try to resolve the image in your head, which, when combined with the sounds of the scene, makes it impossible to ignore the atrocity.\n\n### [_The Boy and the Beast_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-boy-and-the-beast/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-13</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI spent the first five minutes thinking that the movie would follow a somewhat conventional martial-arts master-apprentice story: master learns from apprentice much more than vice versa; apprentice is missing a father figure and finds father figure in the master; together, they make each other stronger, and only through their combined strength can they ultimately defeat their adversaries, etc.  And for the most part, the movie is exactly that, and these were the parts I found most enjoyable.  There was an unexpected mid-movie detour where the boy leaves the fantastical beast world which has adopted him and returns to the human world, and he makes a girlfriend and reunites with his missing birth father.  I found this part overly sentimental and dripping with the teenage angst that is my least favourite aspect of much of the anime I see.  Much more entertaining is the comedically dysfunctional relationship between the two title characters, and the visually spectacular fight scenes, i.e. the most predictable parts of this type of movie.  Perhaps I am a sucker for formula.\n\n### [_Embrace of the Serpent_](https://letterboxd.com/film/embrace-of-the-serpent/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-14</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\n\"They are now the worst of both worlds.\" That's what Karamakate, an Amazonian man, says of a Catholic missionary, where a mad priest has come under the delusion that he is Christ, and has created a cult-like following of native converts. Karamakate visits the same site twice, once as a young man and again when he is older, and both times, violence arises because of the clash between cultures. This is a dense movie, and the themes are hard to unpack (and would probably require a second viewing to do so), but the feeling of uneasiness arising from the collision between two cultures is always there.\n\nThe black and white cinematography made for many memorable shots of the flowing river, where the undulating water is at times closer to black like molasses and at times closer to white like milk.\n\n### [_Cemetery of Splendor_](https://letterboxd.com/film/cemetery-of-splendor/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"1.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nSometimes a guy taking a shit is just a guy taking a shit.\n\n### [_Anomalisa_](https://letterboxd.com/film/anomalisa/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nGood customer service requires you to treat every customer as an individual. Not everybody can do this. It's a talent. So what can a common, untalented customer service representative do but learn how to follow a program, a script, a procedure that when you follow it will make the customer feel as if they are being treated as a special, unique individual? The paradox is that our CSRs are all following the same script, the same way to every customer. So but what if you were so good at customer service that you became the expert in the field, and you were the one who creating this script, this procedure, and in the process of creating this thing you saw through the paradox, and knew that you were creating a world where everyone was the same?\n\n### [_Victoria_](https://letterboxd.com/film/victoria-2015/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt's amazing, how they managed to pull off a long extended single take, and it's an impressive technical achievement, and one wonders how they accomplished certain scenes, like a virtuosic piano performance by the main character Victoria, or a shootout where we see someone get shot and wounded (like, he must have been carrying some sort of vessel of fake blood since the beginning of the movie, or else someone handed it to him while he was off-camera), but then also at the same time, a growing feeling of annoyance and irritation crept in as the film went on, and even though on the surface one is impressed, one wonders why Victoria would hang out with this bunch of jerks, instead of going home already, because some guys are clearly up to no good, it doesn't matter how charming his posturing and lies may be, just go home already, and then also, as if one's dislike of the characters wasn't enough, one also experiences motion sickness because of the constantly moving and shaking camera, so much so that one just wants them to get caught already and get punished for their crime, so that the movie can end, one has to close one's eyes until it ends, because one just wants it to end.\n\n### [_The Whispering Star_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-whispering-star/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2015-09-19</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI was fascinated by this film mainly as a document of the Fukushima region of Japan. Areas that were affected by the tsunami and nuclear plan disaster are now abandoned and isolated, and the film uses these settings to create alien planets where only a few humans survive. Narratively, it's quite episodic and doesn't contain much conflict, but it contained so much beautiful imagery that I was captivated.\n\n### [_The Jungle Book_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-jungle-book-2016/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-04-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nFavourite lines:\n- \"That's not a song, that's propaganda!\"\n- \"I nap... a lot.\"\n\n### [_Abacus: Small Enough to Jail_](https://letterboxd.com/film/abacus-small-enough-to-jail/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-11</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nA family with so much personality and heart that you forget that they are one-percenters, and nothing bad will _really_ happen to them no matter the outcome. But you root for them still. They're not all bad, the rich.\n\n### [_The Red Turtle_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-red-turtle/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-12</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nSo pure and simple in its storytelling that it feels like a myth or a parable. Cute crabs.\n\n### [_Voyage of Time: Life's Journey_](https://letterboxd.com/film/voyage-of-time-lifes-journey/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\n_Baraka_ and _Samsara_ have done this better, and without the airy narration and questionable CGI. And what's with the muddy cellphone camera footage interspersed throughout? At its best when it sticks to spectacular nature footage a la _Planet Earth_, but then why not just watch that instead?\n\n### [_Salt and Fire_](https://letterboxd.com/film/salt-and-fire/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nWhat Herzog should do is he should overdub this movie with his own voice. Only he can make this dialogue less awkward and unnatural. Least worst performance: GG Bernal in a tiny comic relief role.\n\n### [_Loving_](https://letterboxd.com/film/loving-2016/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nWas hoping for a climactic court room scene but I guess it's not that kind of movie. Was hoping for more drama overall but mood was very subdued, as if trying not to overdramatize it too much in the typical biopic way. Overcompensated perhaps?\n\n### [_Burn Your Maps_](https://letterboxd.com/film/burn-your-maps/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2016-09-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nCute.  Nice.\n\n### [_Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2017-02-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nHard to be objective about this one because of the childhood nostalgia.  This time around, it felt a little too plot-heavy for me... you can tell how much was condensed from the graphic novel (which I would love to read now).  Still visually amazing and thematically rich.\n\n### [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_](https://letterboxd.com/film/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2017-05-12</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nAs funny as expected, but plot is a bit weak. Basically, they meet Kurt Russell, he explains some stuff, and it's nice for a while, until later, when Kurt Russell explains some more stuff, and it's not so nice anymore, and they start fighting.\n\n### [_Phantom Thread_](https://letterboxd.com/film/phantom-thread/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-09-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nBeautiful film about an ugly relationship.\n\n### [_Loving Vincent_](https://letterboxd.com/film/loving-vincent/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-25</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nOf course, the animation is impressive, but I thought the choice to make the flashbacks in a black-and-white photorealistic style was backwards... shouldn't remembrances of the past be impressionistic and colourful?\nThe story itself bothered me. Teasing a murder mystery to explain away suicide feels distasteful. Armand interrogated the villagers in a way that could be described as insensitive at best and harassment at worst.\n\n### [_Cosmopolis_](https://letterboxd.com/film/cosmopolis/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-29</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI've never read DeLillo before, but now I want to. The style of dialogue is right up my alley. Maybe not the most cinematic, but Cronenberg did it a fine job with a seemingly limited budget.\n\nMight be a case of style over substance, though... I didn't think the main character was very compelling, because he just doesn't care about anything. And the attitude of the film was a bit too _male_ for my liking... kind of sex- and gun-happy. The fact that the protagonist's ultimate lesson is symbolized by his prostate says it all.\n\n### [_Black Mirror: Bandersnatch_](https://letterboxd.com/film/black-mirror-bandersnatch/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2018-12-30</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nLacks narrative cohesion, by definition. Too concerned with its own meta-ness...\n\n### [_First Reformed_](https://letterboxd.com/film/first-reformed/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nI would have liked it a lot more if not for the ending. I had been impressed with the film for not creating romance, especially during the \"magical mystery tour\" scene. It's rare to see such an intimate moment, without it leading to something sexual. Not every movie must contain coupling. That's why the ending disappointed me. I would have liked to see Toller deal with his problems in his own right, without falling back on the easy solution that all he needed was love.\n\nI did enjoy the exploration of religion and environmentalism. What I thought would be a film about a man losing his faith, instead became an argument for faith being a tool to strengthen a worldly philosophy. It almost made me, a non-religious man, want to join a church. Almost.\n\nBest scene came early: the first conversation between Toller and Michael. Intensely emotional performances.\n\n### [_Call Me by Your Name_](https://letterboxd.com/film/call-me-by-your-name/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-11</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe reason I know this movie didn't work for me is because I had almost no reaction to the final shot. I should have been bawling.\n\nI think the movie waited too long (until maybe the last three scenes) to have its characters actually express what they feel. Before that, motivations seem vague, and a lot of the dialogue feels like variations of \"why?\" \"just because\"\n\n### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-13</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI miss when movies looked like this. Film grain galore, not all shiny, CG effects that weren't in your face. I think this trilogy was made at the perfect time in the history of film technology.\n\nThis one has always been my favourite. It's got the most adventure, and it shows you so many new things. The extended battle scenes that define the other two were always a little boring to me. Gonna revisit the rest of the series in the next couple days. Can't wait.\n\n### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-14</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nWhat I think is my least favourite of the three, to be confirmed tomorrow.\n\nVisually, much more drab and grey than the first. Thematically, more of a war movie than an adventure.\n\nA messy climax, jumping between two or three battles at once.\n\nThe Gimli comedy feels one-note.\n\n\"Gollum's Song\" is my favourite piece of music to come from this trilogy.\n\n### [_The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-return-of-the-king/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-15</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nBalances the adventure of the first with the war movie elements of the second. The story is better integrated into the battle than in Two Towers.\n\n### [_Far from the Tree_](https://letterboxd.com/film/far-from-the-tree-2017/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-16</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nPositive message of love and acceptance. Just made me happy.\n\n### [_The Big Sick_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-sick/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-17</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nA timeless romance between a guy and a girl...'s parents...\n\nI do wish we'd seen Kumail and Emily's relationship (re)develop after the titular Sick. Chemistry between characters was great all around.\n\n### [_Predestination_](https://letterboxd.com/film/predestination/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nSomebody please draw me a diagram\n\n### [_Bumblebee_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bumblebee/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-19</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nAlmost tried a little too hard in its un-Baying.\n\n### [_Fyre_](https://letterboxd.com/film/fyre-2019/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nEntertaining to watch in a trainwreck kind of way, but kind of disturbing by the end. I hope there is justice for everyone involved, especially the local workers who didn't get paid.\n\nMakes me wonder how a person like Billy comes to exist. Can they make a prequel about his childhood?\n\n### [_Shirkers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/shirkers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nEnjoyed the colourful footage from the past. Felt really bad for the filmmakers for having their hard work stolen from them.\n\nOne thing I had trouble with was how _Shirkers_ (the documentary) seems to take for granted that _Shirkers_ (the indie film) would have been in some way historically significant. How do we know that? I don't think this documentary needed that stance, as a story about a personal loss (not necessarily a cultural one) would be compelling enough.\n\nP.S. watching this on the same day as FYRE made for an inadvertent \"Male Egotist Taking Advantage of His Position of Power\" double feature.\n\n### [_Blade Runner 2049_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blade-runner-2049/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-21</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nSome highlights for me:\n\n- Sometimes, on the soundtrack, there's an electronic buzz that sounds like motorcycles revving. Could be part of the score, could be part of background noise. Very cool.\n\n- The scene where Luv interrogates the Lieutenant... Luv is the aggressor, and has the upper hand, but in the middle of yelling, sheds a couple of tears. I think it might have been accidental, the actress just getting overwhelmed by the scene, but it works to show how emotionally unstable that character is.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't think the story was successful overall. I wanted to just enjoy the visuals, and I did, but often found myself being distracted by questions arising from the plot.\n\n### [_Eighth Grade_](https://letterboxd.com/film/eighth-grade/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nThere's not much nuance here. When you see the boy you like, a loud electronic soundtrack will play. When you explore your sexuality, your dad will walk in. When you feel down, there will be a voiceover of yourself, giving a motivational speech.\n\nSome of the sincere moments near the end redeemed it, but I spent the first half of the movie feeling weary about the sustained cringe.\n\n### [_Black Panther_](https://letterboxd.com/film/black-panther/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-23</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe rare MCU film which improves in second viewing. Noticed the depth of performances this time around.\n\n### [_Nothing Like a Dame_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nothing-like-a-dame/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-26</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI might not be British enough for this\n\n### [_Three Identical Strangers_](https://letterboxd.com/film/three-identical-strangers/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-01-31</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nI was excited to watch this, but turned out a bit disappointing for me. I thought the movie tried too hard to create shock. Twin studies are common, and not that shocking in itself. The film could have done more to explore the ethical implications of non-consensual separation (this is the truly shocking part), but gets too caught up in editing tricks, trying to make the very existence of scientific experimentation into a plot twist.\n\nI also had problems with the stuff near the end, when the movie tries to hurriedly weigh in on the nature-vs.-nurture debate. The film has sat on the nature side of the fence for most of its runtime, but decides to flip-flop at the end, towards the nurture side. The effect is that the dead triplet's adoptive father, who has not had much screentime up to this point, suddenly gets turned into a scapegoat. It was not a fair treatment of the issue, in my opinion. I would have preferred a more balanced approach, instead of saving one side of the argument to the end as a kind of forced catharsis.\n\n### [_Pope Francis: A Man of His Word_](https://letterboxd.com/film/pope-francis-a-man-of-his-word/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-03</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nI enjoyed listening to him talk. He's got a gentle, wise way of speaking. I'm not Catholic or religious, but I'm glad to see a religious leader embracing change, and spreading a message of equality and environmental stewardship.\n\nThe film does well to convey the Pope's message, but left me a bit frustrated because I wanted to see how his message translates into action. What can the church do to address the issues that he talks about, beyond making speeches? How do members of the church act upon the Pope's leadership?\n\n### [_Sorry to Bother You_](https://letterboxd.com/film/sorry-to-bother-you/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nI found it a little messy, and the humour was hit or miss.\n\nE.g., hits:\n- the interminable security code in the elevator\n- the Cash and Sal \"you smell nice\" staredown\n\nE.g., misses:\n- Squeeze and his bullhorn STD rant - kind of deflated the emotion of that scene\n- forced rapping at the party - ended with a somewhat obvious joke\n\nThen there's the big twist. I grant that it worked viscerally, almost like a horror movie reveal. But in terms of character, having that be the catalyst for Cash's redemption cheapens it. After being tempted into a morally bankrupt Power Caller position--by wealth, by glamour, by prestige--I wanted him to return to the \"good side\" via some kind of internal conflict. Instead, he's confronted with a proposal that no one in their right mind would accept.\n\n### [_A Dog's Purpose_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-dogs-purpose/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nAs an unabashed dog lover, I can't _not_ enjoy a movie like this, purely on a look-at-the-cute-puppies level.\n\nOf course, I know full well the narrative failures of this story. Its use of reincarnation as a premise doesn't mesh with my philosophy; to me, each reincarnated life should be an equal part of the whole, a segment of an infinite cycle. In this movie, the life with Ethan has the most significance. It makes it feel like the lives in the middle (as police dog Ellie, and family dog Tino) were just shoved in there to get Ethan to the appropriate age for Dennis Quaid. They don't add anything to the story, and the death scenes, which can't _not_ be sad, don't feel earned because we haven't spent enough time with those characters.\n\n### [_Bad Times at the El Royale_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bad-times-at-the-el-royale/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-02-17</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nEnjoyable performances all around, especially Lewis Pullman and Cynthia Erivo.\n\nA couple of characters could have used more development. Cult leaders and members are not necessarily murderous psychopaths. Why were Rose and Billy the way they were?\n\n### [_Venom_](https://letterboxd.com/film/venom-2018/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nI can't sleep on planes, so I took a sleeping pill before my flight. They say sleeping pills don't work by putting you to sleep, but by keeping you asleep. You still have to fall asleep. Good thing I was watching Venom.\n\n### [_The Predator_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-predator/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"1.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nMessy as hell. Couldn't even tell how characters get from one shot to the next. And why did they waste the opportunity to show the suit in action?\n\n### [_Captain Marvel_](https://letterboxd.com/film/captain-marvel/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nAvoided the problem of boring origin stories. Carol discovering the origin of her powers _is_ the story.\n\n### [_Thoroughbreds_](https://letterboxd.com/film/thoroughbreds-2017/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-14</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nStylistically, it was cool (even though there were a few too many lingering filler shots). I dug the droning horror movie soundtrack.\n\nUltimately, I couldn't buy that Lily would actually go through with her plan. She hasn't shown that she's the type of person who would do that. I know that's supposed to be the point, that she's the truly psychopathic one, and not Amanda; but I just didn't believe it.\n\n### [_The Meg_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-meg/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-03-18</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nOh Pippin 😍\n\n### [_Enemy_](https://letterboxd.com/film/enemy/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-05-26</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nInitially, I had problems with the character motivations in the final act. Had to watch a couple of YouTube video essays to fully understand it, but I buy it now.\n\n### [_You Were Never Really Here_](https://letterboxd.com/film/you-were-never-really-here/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-05-31</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nEffectively unsettling and disturbing. Loved the unusual scene where Joe and a henchman sing a song while henchman dies. Elements of _Taxi Driver_ and _Top of the Lake_, the latter in particular because of the \"Powerful Men are Behind the Pedophilia Ring\" trope. In both cases, the twist is just given without further explanation. It troubles me a little that writers expect audiences to accept this kind of twist so easily.\n\n### [_Upgrade_](https://letterboxd.com/film/upgrade/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-02</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nOnce you get past the fridging setup, there's fun to be had with the action.\n\n### [_Alpha_](https://letterboxd.com/film/alpha-2018/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nQuestionable CG and kind of emotionally flat. Still enjoyed the wolf though, when it was real.\n\n### [_Coco_](https://letterboxd.com/film/coco-2017/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nVisuals are amazing. The first half felt procedual to me, just connecting the dots between plot points. But still made me cry by the end.\n\n### [_Searching_](https://letterboxd.com/film/searching-2018/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-06-22</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nEnjoyed the technique and performance by John Cho. Not such a big fan of the final solution of the mystery.\n\n### [_The Incredible Hulk_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-incredible-hulk/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-01</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nHe's too scary in this. Definitely appreciate Ruffalo's more friendly Hulk.\n\n### [_Suspiria_](https://letterboxd.com/film/suspiria/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nOoh, colourful\n\n### [_Suspiria_](https://letterboxd.com/film/suspiria-2018/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-20</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nI wish they'd have had more confidence to make the cinematography look good in the climax, instead of the frame-reduced red-saturated thing that we get. Other than that, loved the mood and performances.\n\n### [_The Rider_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-rider/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-07-31</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nI thought the amateur performances would work against the film, but instead, it highlights the real risks that Brady faces, even when training horses. Making the film itself would have been a risk, but he chose to do it because it's another way to express what he loves.\n\n### [_Mountains May Depart_](https://letterboxd.com/film/mountains-may-depart/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-08-31</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nImpressive scope which reflects real life: people who are \"supposed\" to be connected don't always stay that way.\n\n### [_Maria's Paradise_](https://letterboxd.com/film/marias-paradise/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-06</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThere's a couple of scenes where Maria seems to display superhuman strength. (Jumps off a moving train... runs off unharmed. Jumps out a second storey window... runs off unharmed.) Is this supposed to show that she's under divine protection?\n\nOther than this one oddity, I didn't find much depth to the story. I wanted to see more of what Maria actually believed. We seem to take for granted that cult leaders are evil... what makes them do what they do?\n\n### [_Bombay Rose_](https://letterboxd.com/film/bombay-rose/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nLovely animation, which allows characters to shift between (day)dreams and reality. The best visual touch was when the teacher walks through the streets, and the busy buildings transform into smaller structures from the past, while the whole image fades into black and white.\n\nI was expecting a romance, but actually, the two leads don't even talk to each other until near the end. Their romance is built entirely on glances and gestures. That's okay, though, because there are plenty of side characters (the teacher, the grandfather, the street kid), and the interconnected stories pay off well.\n\n### [_Wet Season_](https://letterboxd.com/film/wet-season/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-08</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nCould have ended one scene earlier, on the toilet. The sound of her laughing and crying at the same time would have been a powerful and emotionally ambiguous cut to black.\n\nThe second film I've watched recently (after _Mountains May Depart_) featuring the young-student-sleeps-with-older-chinese-teacher-and-later-someone-mistakes-him-for-her-son trope.\n\n### [_A Hidden Life_](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-hidden-life-2019/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nIt took me some time to get into the rhythm, but I think I got there in the end. I wish the main character had spoken more... it felt like many scenes consisted of his peers angrily yelling rhetorical questions at him (\"What of your family? Do you think your actions will change anything? What is this for?\"), and he just paces and stares back. He has the answers but doesn't speak them. August Diehl did a Q&A after the screening and he said that he was going for a silent resistance. I get the sentiment, but it frustrated me a bit.\n\n### [_Henry Glassie: Field Work_](https://letterboxd.com/film/henry-glassie-field-work/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-09</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nFor the first half hour, the film is simply watching Brazilian artists make stuff. I was thinking, this is cool, but you gotta give me some information and some context. Thankfully, the film does, and when Glassie speaks, he's full of wisdom about art and humanity. (To paraphrase, \"art is the reconciliation between being both alone and a part of society.\") For the final third, the film reverts again to just watching pottery makers work. By that time, all of my impatience was gone... I understood that what Henry Glassie does is all about observation, and I wanted to be a part of it.\n\n### [_The Perfect Candidate_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-perfect-candidate-2019/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nI liked the positive attitude of the film; most of the characters around Maryam are supportive. On the other hand, it didn't feel like there was much conflict beyond the obvious gender segregation and discrimination. In particular, the subplot with the father's touring band didn't do much more than providing some nice musical interludes. The director said that she added music for her ailing mother, so I'll let it slide.\n\n### [_No. 7 Cherry Lane_](https://letterboxd.com/film/no-7-cherry-lane/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>2019-09-10</small>\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly /></span>\n\nFirst, the visuals. There is beauty in the still frames, but as soon as the characters start moving, it feels unnatural. They move too slowly and stiffly.\n\nThe story was a mess. First half was okay, and I could buy into the relationship between Fan and Mrs. Yu. But then it makes a sharp turn, and he's suddenly going out with the daughter instead.

I also like to record my experiences, for example, by tracking the books I read on [The Storygraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/), and tracking the movies I watch on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/).\n\nThere’s an app called [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) which is great for readers like myself. In the app, you can point your phone’s camera at the text on a page, and it will use [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) to save it as a quote. The app also allows you to review the quotes that you’ve saved in the past. It’s fun to revisit the favourite bits from books that I’ve read. The Readwise app implemented well, and I found it useful enough to pay for a subscription.\n\nHaving said that, I’m a firm believer in owning one’s data, so I decided to try to create my own solution. Introducing… [“Quoteshelf”](/quoteshelf)! This new section of the website contains all of the quotes that I’ve exported from Readwise. On the main page, I can swipe through a random selection of quotes, and I can browse the [author index](/quoteshelf/authors) to find specific books.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nGoing forward, I’ll be capturing my reading highlights here instead of in Readwise. No offense to them, but my goal here was to remove a dependency on an external service.\n\nSome technical lessons that I’ve learned:\n- I didn’t know this before, but the iOS [Notes app has OCR built-in](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/iphone/iph653f28965/ios).\n- The quotes are stored in YAML files, and I’m using Astro’s new [content layer API](https://astro.build/blog/content-layer-deep-dive/) to work with the data.\n- I don’t have a great way of automatically downloading the images for the book covers. I settled on a process of finding the covers on [Google Books](https://books.google.com) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), and either saving the images manually, or adding a URL to my data files.\n- The scrolling carousel is implemented using the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) library. It works pretty well and has decent documentation.",

		"content": "[Previously…](/blog/2024/12/servant-s1-s2)\n\nI was a big fan of [_Lost_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29) while it was airing. I know it had its naysayers, because I used to passionately defend the show against them. With the benefit of hindsight, I can definitely see how the plot became a mess; it’s clear that the writers didn’t have it all fully planned out, and had to sacrifice many loose threads in order to bring the story to a conclusion. But I felt at the time, and still maintain, that the ending was emotionally satisfying on a character level, even if some/many of the mysteries went unexplained.\n\nThe same could be said of _Servant_, which also offers plenty of supernatural twists, albeit on a much smaller scale. (Instead of a whole island, with dozens of characters, _Servant_ takes place almost entirely in one house, with a primary cast of four.)\n\nI said in [my previous comments](/blog/2024/12/servant-s1-s2) that in the end, I only cared about the main emotional resolution, and the show delivered. (I was also right that it waited until the second-to-last episode to deliver it.) When Dorothy, the mother, finally realizes the truth that she’s been suppressing for the entirety of the show so far, it’s appropriately heart-wrenching, but also feels like a relief. It’s the only way they can move forward from the tragedy.\n\nNell Tiger Free as Leanne remains the MVP for me, even though I didn’t love the turn that her character takes in season 4, becoming a full-on evil wacko killer. She was much more interesting when her nature was ambiguous, even to herself. But the disquieted, damaged innocence that she carried in earlier seasons does return in the finale, which makes her fate bittersweet.\n\nI’ll also shout out the rest of the main cast (Toby Kebbell, Lauren Ambrose, Rupert Grint). The show works mainly on the strength of their performances. They make the more ridiculous supernatural plot elements much more believable.",

		"content": "A fun page-turner about a woman who visits “The Centre,” a place where people can go to learn new languages. Amazingly, you can go from complete ignorance to full fluency in only 10 days. All it takes is to cut yourself off from the outside world, sit in a cubicle with headphones on, and listen to a recording of someone speaking in your target language all day. There’s a dark mystery surrounding how the process actually works, and the novel gets a lot of mileage from doling out little pieces of the puzzle over time.\n\nThe protagonist is a Pakistani immigrant to England, and at one point, she visits her family back home; also, she befriends the manager of the Centre, and together, they go to India, where the founders of the Centre reside. These travels allow the novel to touch on the immigrant experience, as well as the fraught history of India and Pakistan, and how those two nations relate to each other.\n\nUnfortunately, these digressions, while interesting, felt a bit disconnected to me. I enjoyed the book mainly because I wanted to find out what the twist was, and the relationships between the characters, and the accompanying cultural and society commentary, seemed engineered to allow the plot to reveal itself, and therefore not entirely believable.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cd10cd2b-aa8c-4f2d-995c-0ba04f9060eb)",

		"content": "I’m not sure how you would categorize this novel, but maybe it wouldn’t be a stretch to call it a rom-com. The main character, Greta, works as a transcriptionist for a therapist, listening to recordings of the sessions and typing them up. (Sounds like a great job to me.) But what gives the story a surreal edge is that she lives in such a small town that she’s constantly encountering the people whose voices she’s been listening to. Imagine that whenever you meet someone in a social situation, you already know their deepest and most secret thoughts, even though you’re a stranger to them.\n\nThe title refers to Greta’s nickname for one of the patients, a young Swiss woman, who shares with the therapist (and therefore, Greta) a traumatic story of physical assault. Predictably, Greta ends up meeting Big Swiss, at the dog park, and the two of them strike up a friendship which becomes a fling. Because Greta knows about Big Swiss’s past, the relationship dynamic is messed up from the start. It feels both funny and icky at the same time, similar to how Tom Hanks is both charming and sleazy in [_You’ve Got Mail_](https://letterboxd.com/film/youve-got-mail/).\n\nGreta herself also survived trauma in her past, and one of the novel’s strengths is the conflict between the two women’s worldviews regarding their history. Greta has the tendency to fall back on her past as an excuse for her misdeeds, while Big Swiss believes in moving on by repressing her experience. The novel isn’t saying that there’s a right or wrong way to deal with trauma, only that people must try their best to figure out how to survive and flourish after. You’re left hoping that Greta and Big Swiss come away from their relationship having learned the lessons that they needed from each other.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/83e41998-b29e-48e0-9d5f-13a6709943cf)",

The last [couple](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-vs-kong/) of [entries](https://letterboxd.com/film/godzilla-kong-the-new-empire/), especially, have been mind-numbingly stupid.\n\nI recalled kind of liking the one that started it all, 2014’s _Godzilla_. Unfortunately, I don’t think it holds up. The imagery is cool when Godzilla is on screen, and evokes a _Jurassic Park_ kind of awe. But there’s too much uninteresting family drama with cardboard characters, which really drags.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4558720b-398c-42b8-a4a7-29f070175786)\n\n## [_Alien: Romulus_](https://letterboxd.com/film/alien-romulus/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nAnother series that I’m fascinated by, even though only the [first](https://letterboxd.com/film/alien/) [two](https://letterboxd.com/film/aliens/) are genuinely great. I like how the monsters look and how each movie gives some variations of the design. The mythology is a muddled mess, but part of the fun for me is being confused by it, I think.\n\nPeople seem to like this newest entry in the series because it “goes back to its roots” of being a straightforward horror/action thriller. It works as such and I enjoyed it, but I found myself missing the convoluted lore that we got in [_Prometheus_](https://letterboxd.com/film/prometheus/) and [_Alien: Covenant_](https://letterboxd.com/film/alien-covenant/), even though, again, I don’t think those were very good. It’s a paradox!\n\nP.S. the variation of the alien design that we see in _Romulus_, which comes from (spoiler) <span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">a hybrid of alien DNA (?) and an unborn human fetus</span>, was a weak point for me. I thought it looked silly and “fake” and didn’t have the same menace as the traditional xenomorphs.\n\n## [_American Fiction_](https://letterboxd.com/film/american-fiction/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3153e12a-1045-4dd7-8880-b2a5196cc1c8)\n\nI laughed a lot at this satire of the publishing industry, and how it treats writers of colour. (See also: [_How to Read Now_](/blog/2024/05/how-to-overanalyze) by Elaine Castillo and [_Yellowface_](/blog/2023/10/yellowface) by R. F. Kuang.) Jeffrey Wright plays an unsuccessful author who decides to pull a prank by writing an exaggerated version of the type of “Black novel” that the market seems to want. To his embarrassment, it becomes a bestseller, and he has to put on a thuggish persona for the benefit of the publishers and their marketing departments.\n\nObviously, there’s no such thing as a monolithic “Black experience,” and the problems that he deals with are nothing like the stereotypes that he depicts in his book. His relationship with his family, and how they must deal with their aging mother, is painfully relatable.\n\nI wasn’t a huge fan of the ending, which (spoiler) <span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">tries to take an _Adaptation._-like turn, as in “And now you’re watching the movie that I wrote.”</span> It broke the authenticity of the characters and felt thrown in for a cheap meta-joke.\n\n## [_Oddity_](https://letterboxd.com/film/oddity-2024/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nA small independent horror film, featuring a blind and apparently psychic woman who tries to avenge her twin sister’s death. She has a creepy-looking wooden life-size statue that often occupies the background of shots, menacingly out of focus. There are quite a few well-executed scares, but I kind of predicted where the plot was going pretty early on, which deflated the tension for me somewhat. Also, the villain is a bit on the cartoonish side. Still, I would recommend the movie overall.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4af37275-e42b-4766-9572-9bf5377ad826)\n\n\n## [_Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga_](https://letterboxd.com/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThis is probably an unpopular opinion, but I liked this more than [_Mad Max: Fury Road_](https://letterboxd.com/film/mad-max-fury-road/).\n\n- the action scenes have more variety, rather than just a chase scene that goes in both directions\n- characters have more character, rather than just screaming and mumbling\n- cool economic world-building with a triangular trade system, and how the collapse of one node can bring down the other two\n\n## [_Blink Twice_](https://letterboxd.com/film/blink-twice/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.0\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nIf I were to tell you that a billionaire CEO was holding parties on a private island, and inviting young women along, would it surprise you to then hear that something untoward was happening to these women? Unfortunately, there have been so many real-life stories about abuses of wealth and power that it doesn’t work as a twist in a movie.\n\nI grew impatient during the first half of the movie, which is filled with fun-times montages like an ad for an all-inclusive resort, but with hints of darkness and confusion. It’s actually technically well-made, but again, I had clued into what was happening before the characters did, so I was just waiting for the shoe to drop. But the film does pick up for a satisfying ending, once the tables turn.\n\n## [_Star Wars_](https://letterboxd.com/film/star-wars/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nI was just watching this in the background while doing other stuff. It’s one of those movies that I know in my bones, so I don’t really have to pay attention to enjoy it. I laughed out loud when Princess Leia says, of Chewbacca, “Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?”\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/c0c5bcbe-2de3-45bf-9eb8-4e0584d0bcf2)",

		"content": "[Previously…](/blog/2024/11/prelude-to-foundation)\n\nIn this second prequel novel for the _Foundation_ series, we follow Hari Seldon as he works on his theory of psychohistory, while the Galactic Empire of which he is a citizen begins to decline. There’s a race against time, because he hopes that his theories will lead to a recovery plan, a way for humanity to continue after the fall. Much of the decline takes the form of political unrest, and also the more mundane processes of failing infrastructure. The machinery that keeps society running continually breaks down, and there’s not enough money to maintain it. I felt somewhat unsettled because it’s hard not to see the same symptoms in the real world.\n\nThe novel is divided into four main sections, each occurring about ten years apart. In each section, he has to solve some crisis, like the increasing popularity of a demagogue politician, or an assassination attempt on him and the Emperor, or simply the difficulty of obtaining the funding needed to continue his research. Along the way, seeds are planted for where the series will go. Sometimes, it feels a little perfunctory, like when a character just brings up the idea of establishing a _second_ Foundation, without really going into detail about how they arrived at this idea. I can forgive a little bit of prequel-itis, as the actual stories were enjoyable enough on their own. Plus, I was actually left feeling excited to continue the series, because I’m looking forward to seeing how these seeds will pay off.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nSomething that I did not expect was the book’s treatment of aging. Because it spans decades, we witness Seldon getting older, and his accompanying melancholy. As he becomes elderly, he also loses and mourns his closest relationships, leading to some surprisingly poignant moments. Asimov himself was near the end of his life when he wrote this, so it makes sense that he would be reflecting on mortality through the character of Seldon.\n\nI have to mention one moment which made me laugh out loud. Near the end of the book, Seldon is having a quiet moment, looking out at the city from his balcony. He’s in a contented mood, as his life’s work is finally taking shape. Asimov puts the button of all buttons on the scene:\n\n> He looked out one last time over Trantor and, before turning to make his way back to the gravitic repulsion elevator, smiled and softly said, “Foundation.”\n\nIt’s an undoubtedly cheesy [Title Drop](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop), but I was charmed by it.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d677bda4-ac75-49c6-9181-8c044a8a26c1)",

		"content": "I was so impressed with Nell Tiger Free’s performance in [_The First Omen_](/blog/2024/10/halloween-binge) that I sought out some of her other work. _Servant_ is a suspense/thriller series on Apple TV+, and also boasts the involvement of M. Night Shyamalan, who [I still have a soft spot for](/blog/2023/07/signs), despite the roller-coaster ride that his reputation has (not undeservedly) gone through over the years.\n\nThe show has four seasons, and I think it’s worth giving my impressions about halfway through. The premise alone is a great source of suspense: a couple welcomes a nanny, Leanne, to their home to care for their infant, but we find out that the baby is a doll, and that the actual baby had died sometime before. Substituting the child with a lifelike doll was the only way for the mother to cope with the loss, but her delusion is so deep that she went ahead with her plans to hire a nanny. When Leanne comes onboard, strange things start happening around the house, not least of which is the doll’s transformation into—_gasp!_—a real, live baby!\n\nLeanne (played by Free) carries herself in a creepy, detached way. Her performance is one of the highlights of the show for me. She has the kind of face where the smallest change in expression can switch her vibe from innocence to malice, from fear to aggression, in a split second.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nMost of the show takes place inside the house, leading to a claustrophobic feel, but it manages to avoid visual monotony because of the careers of the parents. The father, Sean, is a consulting chef—i.e. he creates recipes in his home kitchen to sell to restaurants—meaning that the camera has plenty of opportunities for close-up food porn shots. The mother, Dorothy, is a news reporter, and they show her program on the TVs in the house. This becomes a source of wry humour as the show progresses; the style of local news is easily parodiable, as they report on trivial events like a new local swimming pool or a farmer’s market in the neighbourhood.\n\nIn general, I felt like the second season amped up the comedy—e.g., a pizza delivery shop called “Cheezus Crust”—and I appreciated the injection of lightness into the generally dark proceedings. On the one hand, you have pizza puns, while on the other, you have the flashback episode which depicts the cause of the original baby’s death. None of the creepy supernatural stuff reaches the level of horror that I felt from seeing the absolute worst thing that can happen to a parent.\n\nI’m continuing to enjoy this show into season 3, as it adds more layers to the supernatural mystery. I don’t think it’s for everyone, as it’s pretty weird, and the pacing can be quite slow, especially in the first season. I was happy to watch one episode at a time, without the compulsion to binge. Looking ahead, I have to say that the one resolution that I really _need_ to see is the most human one… I don’t care if the supernatural mysteries don’t fully pay off, as long as they get this right: at one point, Dorothy must confront the truth about the inciting tragedy. I have a feeling that the show is going to delay this for as long as possible, and I hope that it’s worth the wait.",

		"content": "A quirky, silly film about a woman who reincarnates and lives several lifetimes, each one taking place in a different century, starting in the 1600’s. In every life, she becomes obsessed with incarnations of the same man, and keeps trying to connect with him. He never seems to return her affections, though.\n\nThe production value is extremely low-budget, but it works. The various historical time periods are portrayed via costumes and set dressing, but the locations themselves are often just an empty room with hanging curtains in the background. It’s going for the _impression_ of a time period, rather than a realistic portrayal, which I respect as a stylistic and pragmatic choice.\n\nUltimately, I had a hard time connecting to the story. I think the film is satisfied with cracking silly jokes, like dubbing the protagonist’s boneheaded husband with dog sounds because his previous incarnation was her pet. I did have a couple of good laughs, but there wasn’t much substance overall.\n\nEventually, the protagonist is reincarnated in the 80’s, and the object of her desire happens to be a famous pop star. I thought that the film had the opportunity to take a turn and comment on the nature of what we call “parasocial relationships” nowadays. But the movie sticks to its frivolous tone, and leads to a kind of empty conclusion.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/timestalker/)",

		"content": "_The Master Plan_ is a play produced by the [Soulpepper](http://www.soulpepper.ca/) theatre company. Adapted from the book [_Sideways: The City Google Couldn’t Buy_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/37255e8f-d68c-4e4b-ab01-8a533b417f91), the play tells the true story of the [ill-fated project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk_Toronto) to develop an unused plot of Toronto land into a futuristic “smart city.”\n\nThe project would have been a collaboration between Sidewalk Labs (a subsidiary of Alphabet), and a government agency. Predictably, the opposing forces of profit-driven capitalism and regulatory bureaucracy ended in a stalemate, and the project was scrapped. The public generally disapproved of the idea, because of understandable fears that residents of the neighbourhood would be spied on, their data sold for profit. Nobody knows if data privacy would have been a real issue, because the project never got very far; on the other hand, even if the project had started off in a benign way, the pattern of [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) predicts that the lives of the “customers” would have eventually deteriorated due to the profit motive.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nAs you can see, the real-life story was complex and fascinating, and I think that _The Master Plan_ is an ambitious attempt to adapt it for the stage. It asks a lot of the actors, who have to recite extended sequences of background information about the timeline of events and the various executives and politicians who were involved. I give the performers a lot of credit for keeping all of it straight, while delivering their lines with energy.\n\nHowever, I felt that the sheer amount of information was ultimately a flaw of the play. There’s a dedicated narrator character who stands off to the side of the stage, whose role is to serve exposition. (“The person speaking is so-and-so, a former manager at blah blah…”) Sometimes, the characters in the scene exit to the side of the stage, and become narrators as well. I think the writers wanted to mix it up, and avoid having a single narrator speak a really long monologue. Even the scenes themselves are filled with minutiae, with many boardroom meetings where deals are negotiated, and characters yell at each other about the rules and regulations of land procurement.\n\nThe play makes a point of reminding the audience that it’s fictionalized, via text that appears on the screens mounted above the stage. (Screens which, I might add, are also used to show PowerPoint-like slides with corporate org charts and timelines, etc.) In my opinion, they should have dramatized it further, and focussed on the human side of the story. To me, much of the content of the play would have worked better as a documentary or a podcast. I would have liked to experience how the situation affected the lives of the people involved, and how they felt about it. I think that the copious amounts of background information could have been boiled down to the essentials, in order to tell a more character-driven story.",

On many of the shelves, something immediately caught my eye: the minimalist white and blue covers of the British publisher [Fitzcarraldo Editions](https://fitzcarraldoeditions.com/). I had only heard of them from [a podcast](https://www.thebookclubreview.co.uk/portfolio/items/fitzcarraldo-editions/), and their reputation for publishing award-winning books, but I’ve never seen them in North American bookstores, and so I made it a mission to get a few. _The Observable Universe_ was one of my selections.\n\nThe author, Heather McCalden, lost both of her parents to AIDS when she was a child, and was raised by her grandmother. Because she was so young, she hardly knew her parents, and they’re defined more by their absence than by the scarce memories that she has of them. This memoir is her attempt to process the loss, and is made up of many “chapters,” many of which are only a few sentences long. Rarely are they more than two pages.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nThis unconventional structure[^1] leads to a somewhat fragmented reading experience. The chapters cover a range of topics: e.g. the history of scientific research on HIV and AIDS, the development of the Internet, personal anecdotes about Heather’s difficult relationship with her grandmother, _noir_-ish accounts of her trying to hire a private investigator to research her parents’ lives. The author’s stated intention is to form connections between all of the fragments, the most obvious one being that pieces of Internet culture go _viral_ and spread in the same way that infectious diseases do.\n\nI was most engaged by the more personal chapters, where she tries to understand who her parents were, culminating with hiring a professional researcher to dig up their pasts. Unfortunately, I don’t think this comes to a satisfying conclusion because there simply isn’t enough information about them, and the search comes up dry. I think there could have been a much deeper exploration of what their absence meant for her, but I felt that the book stuck to its format too rigidly: all of the little Wikipedia-like factoids about the science of infection and the history of the Internet came to overwhelm the emotional core of her story. It felt like she kept circling around what she really wanted to say, and never reached the centre.\n\nHaving said all that, it was a fascinating read, and I respect her effort to do something different.\n\n[^1]: A note on the book’s physical design: each of the chapters starts on a new page, which means that for the shorter ones, there’s a lot of blank space left over. I can’t help but think that this is a waste of paper, but that’s just me being overly pragmatic.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7cb57df7-44c7-4947-aa9e-5f7fd1a7961d)",

		"content": "The [Reel Asian Film Festival](https://www.reelasian.com/) ran last week, and I was happy to see that they offered a digital streaming package.\n\nI’ll be giving some brief thoughts on the films that I saw, in no particular order...\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n## [_Ashima_](https://letterboxd.com/film/ashima-2023/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nA documentary about the rock climber Ashima Shiraishi, and her goal to become, at age 13, the youngest person to complete a [V14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_%28climbing%29#V-grade) boulder. (The film was shot almost 10 years ago, and I don’t really know why it’s only coming out now.) The bulk of the film shows her and her father as they travel to South Africa to attempt the climb. The boulder itself resides in the wilderness, which is captured by some beautiful scenic cinematography. A lot of drama is mined from the way her father pushes her—arguably to the point of bullying—to keep trying even as she repeatedly falls and injures her hands. You can debate whether the Japanese style of high-pressure parenting is “right” or “wrong”; I will refrain from judgement, but it makes for compelling and sometimes uncomfortable viewing.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/5d030a1a-c49e-4237-bf65-6d0b959c3e42)\n\n## [_Nikah_](https://letterboxd.com/film/nikah/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/978e01f6-cd52-493f-8e4d-90910ce16e9f)\n\nShows life in the [Uyghur region of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang) through the perspective of a young woman. There’s pressure from the community for her to settle down and find a husband, but she hasn’t met any prospects that she likes. The story is quite simple, but I appreciated a look into a culture that I haven’t seen before. In the background of it all is the fear of persecution from the Chinese government. There are signs all over town prohibiting certain types of dress and religious rituals. The dread is most effectively conveyed by a couple of shots from the POV of a surveillance camera, where every face in the crowd is [tracked and identified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system).\n\n## [_Lucky Star_](https://letterboxd.com/film/lucky-star-2024/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nA family drama about a father who gets into financial trouble after a [CRA phone scam](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/scams-fraud/recognize-scam.html), and tries to dig himself out of it by playing in underground gambling dens. I wasn’t really engaged by this one; it’s competently made, but fell a little flat. I understand that gambling addiction is a mental illness, but I don’t think the film deals with it as such, and so it just felt like watching someone repeatedly getting himself into trouble for no good reason.\n\n## [_Ben and Suzanne, a Reunion in Four Parts_](https://letterboxd.com/film/ben-and-suzanne-a-reunion-in-4-parts/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/418af426-3e2a-44e5-9676-cb9e48ec9877)\n\nI hesitate to make this comparison because I’m not that familiar with Richard Linklater’s films, but I don’t think it’s a big stretch to say that _Ben and Suzanne_ follows the template of the [_Before_ trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_trilogy). We follow a couple who have been living apart, as they reunite in Sri Lanka for a vacation. Both actors are charismatic and naturalistic, and the dialogue is witty. As with any couple, their worldviews aren’t always fully in sync, and the suspense of watching their conversations throughout film comes from the question: is _this_ the philosophical disagreement that becomes the dealbreaker for them? At the same time, they do genuinely care for each other and make each other happy, so you root for them, despite their conflicts. My favourite of the festival.\n\n## [_Home Court_](https://letterboxd.com/film/home-court/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nAnother sports-themed documentary, this one following high-school basketball star Ashley Chea, as she tries to lead her team to some kind of regional or state championship. Unfortunately, the structure and stakes of the various tournaments were not super clear to me, and the film gets a bit repetitive in the final third, as it becomes a series of highlight reels for game after game. The most compelling moments come from watching Ashley’s personality mature as she learns how to be a role model as the team captain. The film also attempts to create an emotional arc from the strained relationship between Ashley and her mother, but I don’t think it really worked. Unlike _Ashima_, you never really see the tension between them, and so the final reconciliation feels forced.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/f207bb0e-95db-4460-98a7-beb1b921c377)\n\n## [_The Land of Morning Calm_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-land-of-morning-calm/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nTakes place in a Korean fishing community, where one of the fisherman hatches a plan: he will disappear into the night, and his cantankerous boat captain will report that he was lost at sea. As a result, his wife and mother will get his insurance money. It’s a pretty shaky premise for me, because 1) it depends on the captain to keep the secret and live a lie, and 2) I can’t believe that anyone would willingly put his family through such emotional pain, even if they get financially compensated. The best parts of the film for me have nothing to do with this ridiculous scheme, but rather with the day-to-day conflicts that arise from the business of fishing.

		"content": "Each page of this graphic novel is formatted like a Sunday comic strip: landscape orientation, with the title appearing in the first panel, followed by three rows of illustrations. It follows the mishaps of a suburban family, kind of like [_For Better or For Worse_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Better_or_For_Worse) or [_Adam@home_](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam@home), where the kids get into trouble and the parents get flustered. Isn’t it hilarious how the father keeps forgetting the kid’s name? Or how the mom is always sleeping in too late? Some strips have a punchline, but other times, it relies on awkwardness and cringe comedy.\n\nBut then, a darker story arc develops beyond the individual jokes. It becomes clear that the mother is suffering from depression and alcoholism, and that the father’s bumbling absent-mindedness is not just a lovable quirk: he’s genuinely disoriented and confused about the world around him.\n\nI’ll discuss spoilers further down, but before I do, I’ll just say that I recommend reading this book. Something strange is going with this family, and the mystery box opens gradually and has a fun solution. It also gives the characters a satisfying emotional arc. Once you find out what happens, you can’t blame them for their earlier flaws.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nSpoilers below… it’s too interesting for me not to write down.\n\n<span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">It turns out that the two main characters are being transported through the multiverse. When we see them as a family with kids, they had just come from another world where they didn’t even know each other. After another jump, they end up as strangers again, but they find each other, and bond over the fact that they seem to be the only ones who remember the change. Even though they struggled through their life together, they come to miss the kids that they had, and to appreciate each other as partners. It’s a poignant reflection on the power of family, even one which you never planned to have.</span>\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/67079fa0-c68c-4348-b48a-bc20255b924a)",

During my viewing, I held a question at the back of my mind: could America actually erupt into violence? It’s depicted so realistically in the film that sadly, I feel like the answer is _yes_. But also, the film avoids commenting on the specific political realities that would lead to such a scenario, which I think is to its credit. If its messaging were too true to life, I would be so filled with dread while watching it that I would miss the more personal story at its core.\n\nThe protagonists of the film are photographers who pride themselves on documenting the truth in a neutral way. As someone who dabbles in photography, I bought into the film’s insistence on the power of images. Visually, the film gets a lot of mileage out of juxtaposing iconic American imagery—e.g. a Christmas village, a small-town Main Street, the many monuments of Washington D.C.—with soldiers in battle. The action scenes are intense and appropriately scary. Ultimately, the movie shows the inevitability of war journalists becoming hardened and traumatized by the death that surrounds them, and makes you wonder if it’s worth it.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/civil-war-2024/)",

		"content": "_Spoiler warning: Out of necessity, I have to reveal the plot in order to discuss my opinions of this film._\n\nOn the surface, this movie is fun to watch. It’s suspenseful and propulsive, and features a great performance by the lead actor, Willa Fitzgerald. However, I ended up disliking it after giving it a few minutes’ thought.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n_Another spoiler warning, just in case…_\n\nIn an opening crawl, the movie tells us that a serial killer went on a rampage, and then proceeds to show, in a non-linear fashion, a man menacingly hunting down a woman, with flashbacks to them meeting for a one-night stand. But then, plot twist! It’s actually the woman who’s a serial killer, and the man is trying to catch her after their sexy rendezvous ended with her drugging and assaulting him.\n\nMy first problem with the film is that the plot is quite simple aside from the twist, and it tries really hard to make sure that the twist is surprising. Telling the story out of chronological order doesn’t serve much purpose other than to delay the reveal.\n\nBut the much bigger problem for me is that the twist itself feels really gross. When I was a kid, people used to tell a riddle that went something like this:\n\n> A man and his son get into a car accident. The man dies instantly, and the boy is rushed to hospital in critical condition. The doctor takes one look at the boy and says, “I can’t operate on him. This is my son.”\n>\n> How is this possible?\n\nWith the answer being, of course, that the doctor is the boy’s mother. I wonder if this riddle would even “work” on people anymore, but back in the 80’s and 90’s, it was a “gotcha!” way of critiquing gender bias.\n\n_Strange Darling_ is kind of doing the same thing, but in a darker way. It’s basically saying that we need to question the “biased” assumption that men inflict violence on women more often than the other way around. It also implies that women can get away with murder (figuratively, and in this case, literally) because they’re so good at playing the victim. It’s an ugly message that I can only interpret as misogynistic, whether that was the filmmakers’ intention or not.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/strange-darling/)",

		"content": "After watching the recent and presumably ongoing [TV series](/blog/2024/07/foundation-s1-2), I felt the urge to revisit the classic sci-fi _Foundation_  novels by Isaac Asimov. I had read the original trilogy for a course in undergrad, and remember enjoying it back then. I don’t think the TV show is great, but I’m still fascinated by the core idea of “psychohistory.”\n\nBriefly, and without spoiling too much, psychohistory refers to a mathematical theory, created by a man named Hari Seldon, which can predict the path of human societies into future centuries.\n\n_Prelude to Foundation_ is a prequel to the original trilogy. I’ve chosen to read the series in chronological order (as opposed to publication order), because [Asimov himself recommended it this way](https://www.reddit.com/r/asimov/wiki/seriesguide/#wiki_isaac_asimov.27s_.22kind_of_guide_to_the_series.22). As the novel starts, a young Hari Seldon has just presented his ideas at a conference—kind of like a TED Talk, I imagine—and it has caused quite a stir. But, as Seldon repeats many times throughout the book, he doesn’t know how to practically apply psychohistory yet to make actual predictions.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nThe main plot driver of the story is Seldon’s escape from the Galactic Empire’s agents. They want to employ and/or control him because of the power and the danger of predicting the future. It makes for entertaining reading, as Seldon and his love interest, Dors, go on the run through the various sectors of the imperial planet, flirting the whole time. Along the way, he tries to learn the history of the diverse cultures that he meets, in an effort to further his theories.\n\nIt was a bit hilarious to me that he keeps getting into trouble because of his utter lack of respect for the communities that he visits. He’s constantly breaking their cultural conventions and rules, because of his single-minded pursuit of science and truth. I think this is supposed to be an admirable character trait, but to me, he comes across like a loud tourist who antagonizes all of the locals.\n\nI’m a bit befuddled by how this novel fits in with what I know about the _Foundation_ series. In the original trilogy, if I remember correctly, Seldon’s psychohistory predicts the downfall of the Empire. But in this _Prelude_, another key character tells Seldon that the Empire will fall, and that psychohistory can only confirm it. So where did the prediction come from? Maybe it will become more clear in the subsequent books.\n\nI’m fascinated by another aspect of this novel, too. Asimov was nearing the end of his career when he wrote this, and I sense that there was a desire on his part to connect the _Foundation_ novels to his other works. The guy was extremely prolific, and I kind of admire his attempt to glue multiple stories together into one grand mega-series.\n\nI know this book is probably not the best of the series, but I had a good time with it. [My previous attempt at diving into a long sci-fi series](/blog/2024/03/cibola-burn) fizzled out, and I’m hopeful that this will be more thought-provoking than that one.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f34cec80-49ca-410b-b9a3-30c5159a58eb)",

		"content": "[Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/) is a band that I discovered when I was a sophomore at the University of Waterloo. The professor of one of my Computer Science courses, [Prabhakar Ragde](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/), hosted office hours for students to ask questions in a one-on-one or small group setting, and he would announce these sessions by posting to the class [newsgroup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup). He ended each of these weekly messages with a line like, “_This week, I will be playing [name of album] by [name of musical artist]_.” I have a memory of attending his office hours with [_Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Your_Skinny_Fists_Like_Antennas_to_Heaven) playing in the background, and I’ve been a fan of the band ever since.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nThis week, I had the pleasure of seeing GY!BE play at [HISTORY](https://www.historytoronto.com/) in Toronto. Their [latest album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Title_as_of_13_February_2024_28,340_Dead) just came out about a month ago. I’ve listened to it enough that I recognized the pieces that they played, but not so many times that I wasn’t surprised by the way their compositions flowed into each other. If you haven’t heard their music, I would describe them as masters of crescendo: they introduce riffs and motifs in quiet sections with a single instrument, and then build layers of sound on top until the entire band is rocking hard with a beat that makes me want to jump up and down. It’s almost unbearable how loud and intense it gets, and then peters out, and they start over again, quietly, with a different melody.\n\nThis was my second time seeing them play, and I really believe that they’re a band best experienced live. There’s an energy to their performance that is somehow lacking in their recordings. As much as I love their music, sometimes I find that their album production leans too heavily on distortion, and the sound of the instruments doesn’t come through the fuzz. For example, in 2017, I eagerly anticipated the release of [_Luciferian Towers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferian_Towers), because I had seen [this video of their live performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCEsL9wX-uQ) of “Anthem for No State,” and loved it. (They often play new pieces in concert before making the studio recording, and they’re cool with fans capturing and releasing live footage.) But when I heard [the album version of this track](https://godspeedyoublackemperor.bandcamp.com/track/anthem-for-no-state-pt-i), I remember being disappointed, especially since the violin melody is low in the mix and echo-y, and doesn’t have the same emotional _oomph_, in my opinion. I wish that the band would make professionally-recorded live recordings, as that would probably become my favourite way of enjoying their work.\n\nOn a side note, I decided to attend the concert wearing my AirPods Pro in [adaptive mode](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/104979). This has the effect of reducing the volume of sound that reaches your ears, while still maintaining the quality of the music. I think it helps to minimize the discomfort that I can feel in my ears when the music is super loud. Further, because GY!BE uses a lot of distortion, I kind of got the sense that the AirPods were filtering out some of that noise, and that I could hear the individual instruments more clearly.\n\nAll in all, it was a fantastic experience, and GY!BE have cemented their status as one of my all-time favourite bands.",

Although I enjoy horror films, I admit I’m too much of a scaredy-cat to go see them in a dark theatre with the big screen and loud sound.

The acting is just that little bit too self-aware and hammy for it to feel real. I enjoyed the character who stands in for the real-life skeptic, [James Randi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi), simply because my personal beliefs are aligned with his. But in the context of the movie, his over-the-top smarminess breaks the verisimilitude.\n\n## [_Longlegs_](https://letterboxd.com/film/longlegs/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d24bc5e2-ceff-4c76-8264-41e63c543353)\n\nProbably the most hyped horror movie of the year, due to an artful ad campaign. I appreciated the meditative pacing and visual style, featuring lots of wide angle shots, and compositions which place the stuff that you most want to see (or perhaps least want to see) outside of the frame. Nicolas Cage’s performance is more funny than scary to me, reminding me of [that scene in _Kick-Ass_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiWK8ntmsf0) where he’s on fire and screaming. Overall, the story is too messy, and I couldn’t even really understand how all of the supernatural elements tied together. Having a coherent mythology is important for movies like this, and there were too many moving pieces here to make sense of it. Satan worship, [Zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer)-like cryptography, creepy dolls (which were either possessed or were psychic remote controls?), this movie has it all, to its detriment.\n\n## [_Immaculate_](https://letterboxd.com/film/immaculate-2024/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/6722af3e-0e2a-4fe7-ac5e-3817730ffa2b)\n\nThe [first of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films) “nun horror” movies this year, and the weaker of the pair. It’s by no means bad, featuring solid cinematography and an effective screamy performance by Sydney Sweeney. But the scares are kind of predictable, and the story’s sole allegorical idea—that women’s reproductive rights are under threat from religious conservatism—is too obvious to be interesting. Notably, nothing supernatural actually happens in the film (okay, maybe you could say it’s sci-fi with its “Jurassic Jesus” DNA cloning conceit), and so the horror comes mainly from the cruelty of human beings against others.\n\n## [_The First Omen_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-first-omen/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/16bb2f58-60c9-45bf-a24b-8b81f8fedc73)\n\nMy favourite of the bunch! Far more visually interesting than _Immaculate_, with lots of cool old-school camera moves. It adds more layers to the themes of bodily autonomy, including the idea that the birth of the Antichrist is a false flag operation initiated by the church to scare nonbelievers straight. Nell Tiger Free’s lead performance is amazing, and there are several memorable shocking moments, including one which answers the question: what if you could fully see the aftermath of [the car crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp6UIhiWeZY) in [_Signs_](/blog/2023/07/signs)?",

Her emotional refuge is collecting—and hoarding—snails and snail-related paraphernalia; anything that evokes the spiral shape of a snail shell is irresistible to her. Like [_Uzumaki_](/blog/2023/10/uzumaki), this manifests as dense repeated visual patterns that I’m sure would reward repeat viewings. The jerky motion of claymation is inherently “cute,” but the colour palette of mostly browns and greys, as well the perpetually droopy-eyed expression of the protagonist Grace, serve to offset the quirkiness with a dour mood.\n\nOne of last year’s Secret Movie Club selections, [_The Iron Claw_](/blog/2023/12/iron-claw), depicted so much tragedy and loss that were it not based on a true story, I would think that the writers were overdoing it, sacrificing believability in order to tug at viewers’ heartstrings. _Memoir of a Snail_, because of its biopic-like structure, and of course, its title, had me believing that it also was a true story, despite its fantastical and whimsical visuals. I kept thinking, _Wow, how did this person endure so much pain and trauma?_, as if it were a real person.\n\nIt’s only in hindsight that I realize that it must be mostly fiction. Unfortunately, this leaves me feeling deceived. In my opinion, by putting its main character through the ringer, only to give her a twist happy ending, the film strays into emotionally manipulative territory. In the Q&A session afterwards, writer/director Adam Elliot says that he wants to achieve two things with his films: make the audience laugh, and make the audience cry. I think he tries a little too hard to reach this goal.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/memoir-of-a-snail/)",

		"content": "I watched this movie before TIFF, and then I got busy with my “coverage” of the festival, followed by a vacation. But the film left enough of an impression on me that I wanted to circle back and write down a few thoughts.\n\nI opted to watch this rather lengthy movie one hour at a time, over three consecutive days. It’s an unfortunate fact of life that it’s rare for me to be able to spend 3 uninterrupted hours doing any one thing.\n\nAs it happens, _Drive My Car_ works really well as a kind of miniseries with roughly one-hour episodes. The film’s pace is definitely slow, with plenty of quiet passages where characters travel in—you guessed it, a car—but it didn’t test my patience, partly because I was coming to it fresh every day. There’s also a clear three act structure to the story, which lines up nicely at the hour marks.\n\nThe protagonist, Kafuku, is a stage actor and director, who is grieving the loss of his wife. His feelings are complicated, as he is aware that she was having a secret affair with another man. In an ironic turn, Kafuku heals partly by meeting and “befriending” the man who cuckolded him (although “be-frenemy-ing” might be a better term for it). In their tense conversations, the two men never explicitly mention the affair, but they both know that they both know.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nKafuku also heals by bonding with his driver, a young woman who, like him, is numbed by past tragedies. At a key moment, they decide to take a road trip, covering almost the entire length of Japan. Personally, I love driving, and I found myself envying her job as a personal driver. And if I happen to make a therapeutic breakthrough and self-actualize during an epic cross-country drive, that would be an added bonus.\n\nSide note: I followed up my viewing of the film by reading the Haruki Murakami [short story](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e2212813-ac5a-4c8c-9936-7a1710a3b2c1) from which it’s adapted. I’ve bounced off Murakami in the past because I don’t enjoy his portrayals of women, and the pattern continues here. Check this out for an opening line:\n\n> Based on the many times he had ridden in cars driven by women, Kafuku had reached the conclusion that most female drivers fell into one of two categories: either they were a little too aggressive or a little too timid.\n\nIt’s to the movie’s credit that this kind of broad stereotyping is omitted.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/drive-my-car/)",

I was reminded of Sarah Polley’s [_Stories We Tell_](https://www.nfb.ca/film/stories_we_tell/). Both films demonstrate the immense bravery it takes to air out your family’s dirty laundry in such a public way.\n\nIn _Tata_ (Romanian for “father”), Lina’s estranged father seeks her help because he’s being abused by his boss. The irony of the situation is that he was abusive at home towards her and her mother and sister. And yet, she can’t allow him to continue suffering, even as she attempts to confront him about the suffering that he has caused her.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/071a000b-204c-492f-9035-672dac5e25ff)\n\nUnderlying the personal story is a look at the broader culture of traditionally patriarchal societies where men are taught to express only strength and dominance. One scene that really blew my mind shows the father, in a moment of regret, visiting his church to make confession. The priest tells him that he did nothing wrong, and that his daughter should be grateful for his strong parenting. Even as Tata tries to make amends, and to process his own remorse, he gets pulled right back into the cultural traditions that defined him.\n\n## [_The Luckiest Man in America_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-luckiest-man-in-america/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nI had seen the real-life footage of [Michael Larson’s “hack” of the game show _Press Your Luck_](https://youtu.be/bfOm7K8A0Pw), and so when I discovered this film dramatizing those events, I was immediately intrigued.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/844e7441-9264-4e89-8382-394fb47ee62a)\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t think I quite got what I wanted from the movie. I could imagine a version of this story that really dives into the procedural behind-the-scenes logistics of making a TV game show, and what happens when someone like Michael Larson throws a wrench into a smoothly running machine.\n\nThere is a bit of that in the film, but it chooses to focus on Larson’s motivations, which I felt was to its detriment. To say that he did it out of love for his family feels trite, and I didn’t buy it. The most contrived story beat comes when Larson wanders off the _Press Your Luck_ set and ends up in the hot seat on a late-night talk show, whose host just lets him voice his inner monologue about how much he loves his family, apparently while the cameras are rolling. It feels like a dream sequence, surreal to the point of unbelievability, and made me wish the film had taken a more subtle tack.\n\n## [_The Life of Chuck_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-life-of-chuck/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nI’ve been a fan of Mike Flanagan’s stuff for a while (viz. _The Haunting of Hill House_, _Midnight Mass_, _Doctor Sleep_), so I’m glad I got to see him introduce this film at my screening.\n\nIt’s hard to discuss my feelings about the film without spoiling it, so consider yourself warned. The movie has a reverse act structure, i.e. it labels its chapter headings as Act 3, Act 2, then Act 1. (I confirmed by flipping through the Stephen King text at a bookstore that this innovation comes from King’s original work.)\n\nIn Act 3, which again, is the beginning of the movie, we see the world falling apart from climate disasters, like fires and floods so bad that the entire state of California is underwater. I thought this was the most effective part of the movie, as it really played on my real-life anxieties. The characters react to their impending doom with sadness and fear but also a poignant kind of acceptance.\n\nHowever, as we transition into Act 2, we find out that this dying world actually exists within the mind of Chuck, who is terminally ill; as he goes, so does his imagination. From there, we get to relive moments of Chuck’s life, including his childhood in Act 1. It’s mostly heartwarming and uplifting, especially a brilliant extended dance sequence featuring Tom Hiddleston.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/69b06eb6-62c4-4ea5-995d-9e97868d53ae)\n\nBut I couldn’t help but feel that the latter acts undercut the opening of the film. Evoking the tragedy of the climate crisis, and then erasing it by telling us it wasn’t real, made the story feel disconnected to me.\n\nWhat I _think_ the movie was trying to say: humanity is cosmically significant, but we must find the beauty in our individual lives. What I got: humanity is cosmically significant, so let’s just forget about the world’s problems and focus on ourselves. I guess the line between affirmation and fatalism in a fine one.\n\n## [_Mistress Dispeller_](https://letterboxd.com/film/mistress-dispeller-2024/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/8bf0951e-83fa-4643-95e2-446ad39f6b17)\n\nBased on my limited experience with therapy, it appears to be a profession that prefers a hands-off approach. They say that they’re not there to give advice, but rather, to guide you through self-reflection.\n\nWhat we see in the documentary _Mistress Dispeller_ is like extreme therapy: the subject, Teacher Wang, is hired by wives in China whose husbands are unfaithful. Her job is to literally dispel the mistress, that is, to break up the affair. To do this, she inserts herself into her clients’ lives. For example, she instructs the wife to invite her over to dinner as a new friend, and then to pretend to be upset about the husband’s cooking, and to storm out, leaving Wang alone with the man. What results is a conversation that we would normally see in a therapist’s office—she asks him about the causes of his roving eye, and gets him to honestly reflect about his deeper needs—but what fascinated me was how she uses subterfuge and manipulation to instigate a therapy session, like throwing a surprise party for someone.\n\nLater, she uses similar tricks to corner the mistress, leading to the insight that in an extramarital triangle, it’s the mistress who’s in the most pain, not the wife, because she _chooses_ to be in an incomplete relationship.\n\nIt definitely crosses all the boundaries of therapy as we know it in the West, but a more repressive culture like the Chinese requires a stronger hand, I suppose.",

		"content": "Another year, another TIFF. Before I dive into the movies that I saw, I have to comment on the increasingly frustrating ticket purchasing process. New this year, you select seats for every screening while buying the ticket. On the face of it, this has definite advantages: it’s less stressful when entering the theatre because there’s no need to rush to find a good spot, and it leaves you time to freely take that all-important pre-show bathroom break.\n\nOn the other hand, what might not be obvious is that the seat selection is not equally available to everyone. TIFF offers [paid memberships](https://tiff.net/membership) that include discounts on year-round screenings, access to a lounge in the Lightbox venue, and importantly, early access to ticket sales for the festival. Previously, it meant that members had a better chance at getting tickets for popular films, but now, with the seat selection, it means that they get to scoop up all of the best seats, too. When I purchased tickets as a non-member this year, I found that many screenings had only the worst seats left, like the first row right in front of the screen, and I decided not go to that show. In previous years, I would have just bought the ticket, and arrived early enough to find a good seat.\n\nThe resulting feeling is that TIFF is becoming more and more exclusive, where the people who pay the most get the best experience. The festival has always played on its reputation for being the “people’s festival,” in contrast to more insider events like Cannes and Venice, but in my mind, it’s slowly losing its claim to that reputation.\n\nEnd rant.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI saw a pretty good crop of movies this year, including the top two vote-getters of the [People’s Choice Award](https://tiff.net/press/news/tiff-announces-its-2024-award-winners). Here’s a quick rundown of the films I saw, in no particular order.\n\n## [_The Assessment_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-assessment-2024/)\n\nI’ll start with this one because I didn’t actually see the whole thing. I made the mistake of overindulging in a pre-show ice cream treat, and the resulting gastrointestinal distress meant that I had to leave the screening early. [I’ll watch anything with Alicia Vikander](/blog/2023/07/irma-vep), and I enjoyed what I saw of her performance. In the movie’s futuristic, apocalypt-ish world, she’s the austere administrator of an assessment that all would-be parents must go through before having children. The film has a dark sense of humour and a surreal quality, and I could see it being an episode of _Black Mirror_. Looking forward to watching the whole thing sometime.\n\n## [_Emilia Pérez_](https://letterboxd.com/film/emilia-perez/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nIn this genre mash-up, a Mexican crime boss transitions to live as a woman, and tries to atone for her past by creating a non-profit that helps the families of missing people. Why are they missing? Because they’re dead… killed by the criminal gangs that our protagonist used to lead. It’s this moral ambiguity that made the film ultimately off-putting to me. The film wishes to celebrate the redemption of this character (including throwing her a rousing parade), but I didn’t believe that justice had been done.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/09bc95e6-a87b-48d5-bb9b-724398b3ae23)\n\nEven more egregious is the way she treats her family. When Emilia transitions, she abandons her wife and kids, leaving them to believe that their husband and father is dead. Later, she poses as a distant cousin of her previous identity as a way to shower love on the children, and to jealously keep tabs on her ex-wife’s new relationships. The clear deception and manipulation leads to a predictably tragic end, but the film wants us to feel all warm and fuzzy when the kids think that she “smells like papa.”\n\nI haven’t even mentioned that it’s a semi-musical! Every few scenes, they sing and dance! I think that this element of the film saved it for me; the songs and choreography gave my audience a boost of energy. But in hindsight, I feel like the hyper-stylized presentation masks the narrative problems. It’s hard to think through some of the movie’s more harmful messages when you’re busy bopping along.\n\n\n## [_Seeds_](https://letterboxd.com/film/seeds-2024/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"2.5\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThe cast of this tiny low-budget movie features a couple of my favourites from [_Reservation Dogs_](/blog/2023/10/reservation-dogs): Kaniehtiio Horn (who also wrote and directed this) and Dallas Goldtooth. They play cousins who have to defend themselves and their home from a burglar, and they have a casual, jovial chemistry that’s immediately likeable.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/fcdd5a91-b3e0-4bed-ab46-b82ac12d6e5b)\n\nThe aforementioned burglar is after a stash of ancestral heirloom seeds, for planting the [Three Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_%28agriculture%29) crops. He symbolizes the real-world issue of large corporations’—such as the infamous Monsanto—ownership of seed patents, leading to the exploitation of farmers. I like that the film turns this somewhat prosaic theme, and turns it into an action thriller/revenge fantasy. The final act becomes very sadistic (spoiler: <span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">the burglar is caught and tortured graphically</span>), which makes for a jarring tone shift.\n\nI was reminded of Percival Everett’s [_The Trees_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/5e464ba9-f7a9-4d45-af8c-897632134d4f), which similarly couples witty humour with the violent revenge by an oppressed people against their white oppressors. I personally can’t bring myself to root for violence, but I understand the historical reasons for this rage and concomitant desire for vengeance.\n\n## [_The Paradise of Thorns_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-paradise-of-thorns/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly></sl-rating></span>\n\nThis Thai film is set in a durian orchard, where a gay couple makes their living farming the fruit. When one of them dies in an accident, his husband wishes to continue the business, but because their marriage is not legally recognized, the property is inherited by the deceased man’s mother. The situation is complicated by the matriarch’s “adopted” daughter, who also wants to get her hands on the land. It becomes a battle of wills between the old woman’s son-in-law and daughter, both of whom have no official legal standing, and so must gain the mother’s favour in order to have any hope of land ownership and its associated status and wealth.\n\nWhat starts off as an examination of same-sex marriage rights becomes an intense melodrama that spirals to a Shakespearean climax. It gets a little over the top, in my opinion. (Have you ever wondered what a _durian fight_ would be like?) Much of the twisty plot hinges on the motivations or perceptions thereof of the dead character, and the true history of the relationships involved is not clear enough for me to discern what is even fair in this situation.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the lead actors, Jeff Satur and Engfa Waraha, are extremely photogenic and charismatic (read: _hot_), and I enjoyed their performances.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4c7d209d-b91a-4ef1-bb79-b1a3679009a6)\n\n----\n\n[To be continued...](/blog/2024/09/tiff-2024-part-2)",

While I’m not saying that I’m immune to negative feelings, darkness is not my default mode, and I’m usually able to motivate myself just fine. That is to say, I do believe that the despondent mood of _The Bell Jar_ rubbed off on me.\n\nI mean this as a compliment to Plath’s vivid description of her protagonist’s spiral into depression. It’s a harrowing journey which is accentuated by the fact that it sneaks up on you. When Esther’s story begins, the narrative reads like a fish-out-of-water story, of a suburban girl who’s slightly overwhelmed by the big city, but who has enough wit and intelligence to float above and see through the bullshit. Over time, it becomes more and more clear that her detachment is a sign of her struggle to belong in the world. Mental illness can’t always be explained, and the book doesn’t try to do it: it simply lets us experience it through Esther’s eyes.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/36009e3e-c23c-4516-9754-64b7e00e0187)\n\n[^1]: I can’t believe I used this word.

		"content": "This is a moody film, about a pair of friends who bond over a fantasy-action TV show as teenagers. As they enter adulthood, it appears that one of them has disappeared into the world of the show, leaving the other one “stranded” in a miserable suburban life. When I say “moody,” I refer to the creative lighting choices and surreal editing (👍), but also to the acting style, which is monotonous and mumbly throughout (👎).\n\nI understand that the film is an allegory for the trans experience, and I respect it for that. The friend who lives out their life in the “real world” is filled with pain and regret because they didn’t get to exist as their true self in the world of the beloved TV show. However, if I didn’t know ahead of time what the metaphor stood for, I don’t think I would have made the connection on my own, and the film would have really dragged for me.\n\nWhat I could relate to was being obsessed with certain shows in my youth. I’m reminded of the time that a friend called me for homework tips during _Seinfeld_’s Thursday night timeslot, and I got mad and yelled at him to get off the phone. Or the time when YTV aired a mid-season cliffhanger of _Dragon Ball Z_ (right before Goku’s first Super Saiyan transformation), and I got so impatient for the next block of episodes that I used the new-fangled technology of the Internet to write a pleading letter to the TV station.\n\nMy point is, I know what it’s like to be passionate about a piece of entertainment. But in the film, the performances are so (intentionally) dreary that the emotion doesn’t come through. I was left feeling a bit empty by the film, even if I admired what it was trying to say.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/i-saw-the-tv-glow/)",

		"content": "When I started reading this book, I was surprised by its breezy tone. I had expected it to be more serious, given the grandiose subtitle and premise (not to mention the hyperbolic blurbs on the back cover): the author would tell the stories of ordinary people during a single day in history (December 28, 1986), and these tales would add up to show us the universal truths of human experience. But the way Gene Weingarten tells it in the introduction, the whole project was in fact kind of a fun lark that he and his editor came up with over drinks at the bar.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI was enjoying the writing for the first few chapters, especially the one about a heart transplant, a procedure that was still somewhat experimental at the time. I learned a lot about medical history, and the events leading up to the operation are told in a compelling, suspenseful way.\n\nAfter a while, though, the writing style started to get on my nerves. There’s a kind of clickbait-y rhythm that gets repetitive, in my opinion. A lot of it reads like: “This is Joe. Joe’s just a regular guy. But little did he know that his life was about to change.” Or: “Sue was just going about her regular day, but there was something dark hidden behind her routine.” It feels like there’s a mini-cliffhanger on every other page, and while it does hook the reader, I feel like the technique is overused here.\n\nBy the end of the book, I was questioning the ethics of the whole thing. Many of the chapters have some element of true crime. For instance, the heart in the aforementioned transplant actually came from a young man who had committed a murder-suicide, and the book spends a lot of time on how he was a tortured romantic with a dark soul. Isn’t this what’s wrong with the news media, that they romanticize and sensationalize and exploit the traumatic experiences of ordinary people?\n\nThere are also a few topics that are emblematic of the Eighties—for example, the AIDS pandemic, racial tensions in the US, and life as a closeted transgendered person—which I feel deserve a more nuanced treatment than a single chapter in this book. In fact, Weingarten’s punchy style makes his superficial coverage of these topics feel insensitive and almost offensive.\n\nAs a whole, I didn’t feel like the people in these stories were creating a snapshot of humanity; rather, it felt like they were exhibits to be gawked at.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/37a9690b-eda1-46d2-9cdd-d53bc19996d1)",

		"content": "I was quite impressed with this [short story](https://thewalrus.ca/august-2150/) by Tomas Hachard that appears in the [Summer Reading issue of _The Walrus_](https://store.thewalrus.ca/collections/back-issues/products/july-august-2024). As the title indicates, it takes place in the future, and features a young girl named Clarissa who dives into an online historical archive, where she finds a journal of a girl living in our present day.\n\nThe future society that Clarissa lives in is rebuilding after a climate catastrophe called “the Deluge,” and the journal gives her a glimpse of life before the disaster: the people of that time didn’t know what would soon befall them, and they existed in a mentality split between fear and denial. Sound familiar?\n\nBut all is not well in Clarissa’s future either; as the story progresses, she starts to see the same signs of impending doom that she’s reading in the journal, and the two narratives kind of blend together in a way that I started to be confused about which was which, in a good way.\n\nThis story really triggered my climate anxiety, especially as I was reading it at around the same time as some horrendous [flooding in Toronto](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/torrential-rains-flood-toronto-causing-power-outages-traffic-disruption-2024-07-16/).\n\nThe cyclical nature of the story is really effective in creating an ambivalent sense of the future. On the one hand, humanity has persisted, after the Deluge, and life seems to be relatively normal. But on the other hand, they don’t seem to have learned enough lessons from the disaster to prevent it from happening again.",

		"content": "This show caught my attention because I have fond memories of a road trip with my wife, during which we listened to an audiobook of [_Recursion_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/bbc4a8fd-d198-4656-a800-ab3cdf140ad0), by the same author, Blake Crouch. The common thread between these two stories, and what I suppose is the strength of the author, is a mind-bending, twisty sci-fi plot, featuring a character who is motivated by a specific kind of romantic love, that of loyal, long-term partners. It’s this latter emotional element that makes me a fan of his work.[^1]\n\nIt’s an unfortunate consequence of marketing that one usually knows a bit about the premise of a show before watching it. As a result, the first few episodes of _Dark Matter_ feel a little slow, because we already know the basic explanation for what’s going on. I think it would be cool to dive in completely fresh.\n\nHaving said that, I need to reveal some _**spoilers ahead**_ to discuss what I enjoyed about the show.\n\nDuring the middle episodes, as the protagonist Jason explores the many worlds of the multiverse, the question comes up: knowing that there are infinite variations of every person, where each one made different decisions in their lives, what defines the core of a person? By the end, as those infinite variations of Jason appear in the “home” world, the show answers the question in a fascinating, tragic way: he’s defined by his desire to be with his family, and the one copy that we’re rooting for just happens to have been the one that we’ve been following. They all have equal right to their happy ending, but they won’t be able to get it.\n\n[^1]: I’m reminded a bit of [Robert J. Sawyer](https://www.sfwriter.com/), who I read a lot when I was younger.",

		"content": "_Foundation_ is based on the classic series of novels by Isaac Asimov. I read them a long time ago, for an undergrad sci-fi literature course, and from what I recall, the adaptation is a loose one.\n\nThe show depicts a powerful interplanetary Empire, and a mathematician who develops a method of calculating the course of history, extending thousands of years into the future. He predicts that the Empire will fall, and is allowed to form a Foundation to ease the process of rebuilding afterwards.\n\nIt’s a complicated premise and I think the show struggles to stick to its own rules. Characters keep saying that the math is indisputable, that the fall of the Empire is inevitable, but gradually, the Foundation becomes like an organized rebellion, actively attacking the Empire. I don’t need to root for another David against another Goliath, and I would have been more interested by a story that shows how unpredictable [“black swans”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) can turn the tide of history.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nI’ll stick more to the positives, though. I enjoyed the show in bits and pieces, even if I didn’t find the overarching plot to be compelling, and therefore, I’ll express my praise in point form:\n\n- My MVP is Laura Birn as Demerzel, the robot who serves the Empire. Her performance captures this sense that she’s often on the edge of an emotional breakdown, caused by the pain accumulated over the millennia of her lifetime; but, she has to keep it contained because her programming forces her to.\n- Lee Pace’s statuesque physique and elegance of posture and movement.\n- Several big time jumps, where decades pass between one episode and the next. I like the feeling of having to reorient myself to the realities of a new society. Worldbuilding is often what I enjoy most about sci-fi, and it’s cool that they get to build a fresh world every once in a while.\n- Because of the time jumps, they have to figure out a way to keep the cast around, beyond a normal human lifespan. It works best for the Emperor, who clones himself so that there are always three of him, at different ages. I ate it up whenever they interacted with each other, because it makes real the abstract and universal concept that a person’s attitudes and personality change with age.\n\nI’m not _dying_ to see more seasons of this, but I’ll probably dip back in when season 3 comes out. On the other hand, I have already ordered a copy of the books, and look forward to revisiting those. I think it will be an interesting compare-and-contrast exercise.",

Having said that, by season 3, they’ve found a better balance between exciting game footage and slice-of-life stories about the players and the townspeople.",

		"content": "I recently tore through this fantasy series, which consists of the novels _The Poppy War_, _The Dragon Republic_, and _The Burning God_. It tells the epic story of a young woman who discovers her magical ability to control fire, and uses it to rise to military power. It’s set in a fictionalized version of Asia, with parallels to China, Japan, Taiwan, and a vaguely European colonial power.\n\nThe series kicks off with the protagonist Rin entering an elite military school. It’s a fun way to get introduced to the world, and feels reminiscent of _Harry Potter_, with her making alliances and rivalries with her fellow students as well as the faculty. But then the stakes escalate very suddenly when war breaks out with a neighbouring country.\n\nI got a kick out of the magic system in this fantasy world. Rin and the other “shamans” harness the power of gods; or rather, they act as conduits for the gods, and are never fully in control. The ability to wield magic is as much a curse as anything, and eventually, all shamans go insane because they’re constantly fighting to keep the gods from taking over their minds. It’s also cool how the interplay between magic and warfare is depicted: geography and natural resources play a big role in how they form military strategies, but as soon as a superpowered soldier enters the fray, it completely turns the tide.\n\nI must confess that I didn’t quite finish the final book. I got a bit fatigued by the relentless violence, but even more than that, the character of Rin is motivated by such anger and hatred that it kind of wore me down. I think the story suffers a bit from being limited to only showing her perspective. As the series progresses, Rin shifts allegiances between the various political factions that are involved in the war, but she’s not driven by any ideology, only by rage against whoever happens to be her enemy at the time. I didn’t get a sense of what she was fighting for.\n\nMy read was probably hampered by reading the whole series back to back to back, and within the limited timeframe of library loans. If you want the best experience, I would suggest pacing yourself and letting it breathe.\n\nstorygraph links: [1](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0615f1a6-5a11-41ac-ac49-884a34fcfdb6) [2](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b9a180c2-05a7-40eb-b13d-78e44ac9738c) [3](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3eff052a-7a81-44af-a78a-d323f519c591)",

At their best[^1], they’re great action spectacles that effectively explore the opposing philosophies of Professor X and Magneto. At their worst… well, I didn’t rewatch the bad ones, so I won’t comment.\n\nThese two entries, both directed by James Mangold, stand apart from the rest in the way that they zoom into the psychology of a single character. _The Wolverine_ is the more conventionally comic-booky of the two, featuring ninjas and a cool bullet train fight scene. _Logan_ doesn’t feel like a superhero movie at all, and lands more like a crime drama, with brutal violence that makes you feel every kill.\n\nBoth follow a similar emotional arc for the character: he’s a broken man, haunted by the past, until he finds someone to care for and protect. It’s especially effective in _Logan_, due to the compelling performance by Dafne Keen as Wolverine’s clone-daughter. \n\nI have to say though, Wolverine’s lack of emotional range (99.5% brooding and angry, 0.5% vulnerable) is more noticeably one-note when he’s flying solo and not part of a team.\n\nletterboxd links: [1](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wolverine/) [2](https://letterboxd.com/film/logan-2017/)\n\n[^1]: [_X2_](https://letterboxd.com/film/x2/), [_Days of Future Past_](https://letterboxd.com/film/x-men-days-of-future-past/)",

		"content": "Hi all. I haven’t done one of these in a while. As with any (good) habit, it’s easy to start, but hard to keep up. I’ve been feeling busy for the last couple of months, with the emphasis on _feeling_… I can’t say with certainty that my time has been filled any more than usual, but the experience of busyness has as much to do with how one copes with time management. It’s probably fair to say that I haven’t been coping so well lately. But I'm getting back on track.\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\nBefore I start, let me shout out an old friend: thanks for checking in on me and asking for the next instalment of this newsletter. You know who you are.\n\nI’m not going to try to be super thoughtful or profound in this one. Instead, I’ll just mention a few things that I’ve been up to.\n\n## A trip to Niagara Falls\n\nAt the end of April, we went to Niagara Falls for a few days with my parents, my sister and her family, and two of my aunts visiting from out of town.\n\nIt’s been a long time since I’ve been there. As a kid, I remember being drawn mostly to the flashy spectacles of Clifton Hill, but nowadays, I think I’d be happy to just stand and watch the falls for hours.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3e65886b-789c-4bf3-8693-63a642cac158)\n\nOne of the highlights was visiting the [Bird Kingdom](https://www.birdkingdom.ca/) zoo with my nephews. They had a great time observing up close the many varieties of birds on display.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/a543b9fe-573b-412e-b4ab-7ba7b559f9f3)\n\n## Freelance Life\n\nIf you’re not aware, I work on software projects as a self-employed freelancer. It’s great because my hours are flexible. When I get a meaty project, I find myself diving deep into the work, for better or worse. There’s a joy in learning about different technologies and figuring out how to fit things together.\n\nRecently, I had the chance to work with the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) platform, to enable the users of a web application to make credit card payments. I had a lot of fun doing it, and it definitely contributed to the sense of busyness that I’ve been feeling lately.\n\n## Writing Retreat\n\nEarlier this month, I had the chance to fulfill a dream of mine: I went on a writing retreat. I’ve always fantasized about going to some secluded place, where I would lock myself in a room for days, and churn out half a book. My recent experience wasn’t quite like that, but the reality came as a pleasant surprise: writing doesn’t have to be a solitary endeavour, and a feeling of community can do wonders for creativity.\n\nThe event was run by an organization called [Firefly Creative Writing](https://fireflycreativewriting.com/). Eight writers joined the retreat, along with two facilitators from Firefly, and we gathered in a [house in the woods](https://www.sumaccentre.ca/) near Kingston. Over the course of the weekend, the facilitators led us in group exercises designed to get us into a creative mindset.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3d64f7e9-30c4-4589-ab02-93554ccddcb0)\n\nThere were a couple of extended periods dedicated to silent writing, but I did not sequester myself behind a closed door as I had imagined. Instead, I sat in the dining area, at a large wooden table, where a couple of others were also working. Even though I had just met them, and they were essentially strangers, we all had something in common, and I found motivation in that common goal.\n\nI think of myself as an introvert, who can only truly feel at ease if I’m alone; even though this is true to a certain degree, I discovered on this writing retreat that it’s possible to find comfort in the right community.\n\n---\n\nAs always, feel free to hit Reply if you want to chat!\n\nUntil next time,\n\nAlbert",

With that in mind, I rewatched this pair of Ari Aster films in quick succession, and my snap verdict is: _Midsommar_ has gone up in my estimation, while _Hereditary_ has gone down.\n\nI don’t scare easily at horror movies, but part of the reason is because I tend to avoid seeing them in the theatre. The big screen and loud sound, along with being surrounded by the dark, would probably overwhelm me, and raise the fear factor beyond what I’d be comfortable with.[^1] This is all to give _Hereditary_ the credit that it deserves: it freaked me the hell out the first time I watched it, even in the comfort of my basement man cave. On this second viewing, because I knew what was coming, it didn’t hit me much. I didn’t expect to be scared, but great horror can be rewatched because it offers more than fear[^2], and _Hereditary_ didn’t.\n\n_Midsommar_, on the other hand, opened up for me the second time around. I don’t think it was ever really that scary in the first place, more shocking and disturbing. Without the element of surprise, it becomes a fascinating exploration of how outsiders perceive “foreign” cultures, and the thin line between community and cult.\n\nThings that connect the two films:\n- The lead actors, Toni Collette and Florence Pugh, are both great.\n- Corpses in Aster’s movies have a bloodless, rubbery quality that I “enjoy.” I can’t say they’re realistic, but they’re also not clearly fake. It’s like a gross, macabre version of the Yoda puppet in _The Empire Strikes Back_.\n\nletterboxd links: [1](https://letterboxd.com/film/hereditary/) [2](https://letterboxd.com/film/midsommar/)\n\n[^1]: I’ll always remember the experience of seeing [_Signs_](/blog/2023/07/signs) in the theatre all those years ago. I propose that a recent, comparable film, [_No One Will Save You_](https://letterboxd.com/film/no-one-will-save-you/), didn’t feel very scary to me (though still enjoyable) because I watched it at home.\n\n[^2]: You’re next, _The Exorcist_.",

In other words, less emotionally _evolved_, let’s say. I remember being moved by the core theme of the movie, which—spoiler warning—hinges on the question: if you have foreknowledge that your child would die from a childhood illness, would you still choose to have that child? But, I think the main appeal for me back then were the sci-fi elements. Cool spaceships! Alien first contact!\n\nRewatching it this time around, I’ve been happily married for years. We don’t have kids, but the notion of being a parent is way more immediate and accessible to me now than eight years ago. As such, the movie had a bigger emotional impact for me this time. But the connection that actually resonated the most for me, unexpectedly, was this: pet owners, in most cases, know that they will outlive their pets, and yet, we choose to share our lives with our animals. These can be some of the most fulfilling relationships we have, in fact.\n\nOf course, I’m not equating the loss of a child to that of a pet. But both types of loss highlight the message of _Arrival_, I think: the act of fully loving someone or something requires accepting the possibility of loss. And if you know that the loss is certain, it makes the love that much stronger.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/arrival-2016/)",

		"content": "It’s hard to review this book without mentioning its structure, including what happens in the story. I don’t think it’s the kind of book that hinges on plot points, but I’ll still put a spoiler warning here.\n\nThe prose is structured in short fragments, usually no longer than a few sentences each. It’s reminiscent of [_Dept. of Speculation_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a076c99b-6a76-4a78-a02a-20cec3fcff67) and [_Weather_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/29d077e0-1ce4-4000-b99e-425e6cc89dfe) by Jenny Offill, both of which I enjoyed. There are no real “scenes,” just glimpses into the mind of the main character, an unnamed woman who spends a lot of time on the Internet, and becomes famous for a single tweet. Ultimately, I think I prefer Lockwood’s novel to Offill’s, because of how the style changes meaning over the course of the book.\n\nFor the first half of this book, the style obviously evokes the flood of unrelated content that you experience when scrolling through social media. It’s filled with references to memes and jokes, and would probably not even make sense for the first dozen or so pages if you hadn’t read the jacket copy.\n\nBut then, in the second half, the book shifts focus to a medical emergency involving the protagonist’s infant niece. The protagonist is no longer constantly online, but the style remains fragmentary, taking on a lyrical quality. I came to appreciate that even without the distraction of the Internet, the mind still works this way: when you’re supposedly only thinking about one thing—in this case, love towards an ailing child—you still jump from idea to idea, emotion to emotion. I found it very powerful, and I was brought close to tears by many passages.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/60cf7ed9-b405-440b-b085-36faf970e66f)",

What the new sequel retains is the utter believability of the special effects. You really believe that you’re watching living apes, and that they are [_persons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_ape_personhood) with thoughts and feelings.\n\nI loved the first half of the film, which establishes the culture of the future ape society, through the main character Noa, and then the studies of a monk-like ape named Raka. If the film had stuck with the “buddy search quest” plotline, where the two of them try to find Noa’s missing clan, this would have been a home run. Unfortunately, the film loses steam for me when it introduces a triangular conflict involving a power-hungry self-proclaimed king ape, and a mysterious human girl. The focus shifts to a big action climax instead of fleshing out the motivations of the antagonist(s), and made me miss the moral complexity of the original trilogy.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/)",

		"description": "_How to Read Now_, _How to Pronounce Knife_",
		"content": "Recently, by sheer coincidence, I read a couple of books whose titles both started with the words _how to_. What’s more, the reading of one informed and influenced my reading of the other.\n\n(My only regret is that I was unable to complete the trifecta by also watching [_How To with John Wilson_](/blog/2023/10/john-wilson) at the same time.)\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n# [_How to Read Now_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/094fdc13-ad18-42df-89b0-5f198dce2725)\n### by Elaine Castillo\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nFirst off, let me confess that I didn’t read the entirety of this book. Being a collection of essays, some subjects grabbed my attention more than others. Castillo’s primary project, I think, is to call out the racial injustice that Western culture is built upon. Based on the title, I thought the focus would be more on books and publishing, but she covers all the forms of media that make up the _now_ that we “read.”\n\nI often bounced off Castillo’s style, which sometimes gets a bit academic, even as she discusses pop culture like _The Watchmen_ TV show. On the other hand, there’s a fair amount of snark and passionate hostility when it’s appropriate.\n\nTo attempt to summarize the point that resonated most with me: we are often told that the act of reading (especially fiction) increases our empathy. In essence, by imagining ourselves in the world of a fictional character, we are training ourselves to step into other people’s shoes, a skill that can be applied in real life. I still agree with the psychological principle, but Castillo points out some of the biases that are embedded in this idea. In particular, there’s an expectation, sold by the publishing industry, that books by people of colour need to be stories about the specific trials and challenges of the author’s background. Empathy, in this sense, refers to the white majority’s ability to “understand” other cultures, by reading works that will “teach” them about those cultures. It’s inherently unjust, and I can’t put it any better than Castillo herself (emphasis mine):\n\n> The problem with this type of reading is that in its practical application, usually readers are encouraged—by well-meaning teachers and lazy publishing copy—to read writers of a demographic minority in order to *learn* things; which is to say, as a supplement for their empathy muscles, a metabolic exchange that turns writers of colour into little more than ethnographers—personal trainers, to continue the metaphor. _**The result is that we largely end up going to writers of colour to learn the specific—and go to white writers to feel the universal.**_\n\n# [_How to Pronounce Knife_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/6ed93be1-9e83-4f6e-9056-4d90ad70b446)\n\n### by Souvankham Thammavongsa \n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/420542c3-6bd2-45ff-9258-ba2499f0e03c)\n\nThis short story collection won the [Giller Prize](https://scotiabankgillerprize.ca/2020-finalists/) recently. The first story, after which the book is titled, had me doubting whether it was deserving. Like most of the pieces in the collection, it’s a vignette of the lives of Laotian immigrants and refugees in Canada. The title story highlights the language barrier between a child, her parents, and her teachers in school. The “punchline,” as it were, is that the parents incorrectly tell the child to pronounce the silent _K_ in “knife.”\n\nBecause I was reading Castillo’s book concurrently, I immediately interpreted Thammavongsa’s work as a superficial packaging of the struggles of Laotian immigrants. An English learner making an embarrassing blunder is a trope that calls to mind the well-worn [“being-made-fun-of-for-bringing-smelly-foods-to-school”](https://www.eater.com/22239499/lunchbox-moment-pop-culture-tropes) cliché.\n\nI do think that the opener is one of the weaker entries in the bunch, and was happy to discover the depth of the subsequent stories. My two favourites are: “Slingshot,” about a relationship between an older woman and a young man; and “Mani Pedi,” about a washed-up boxer who gets a job at his sister’s nail salon. In the latter, the main character doesn’t speak any dialogue until the very end, whereas his sister is loquacious and hilariously vulgar throughout. Impressively, his character feels fully developed over only a handful of pages, based purely on the contrast between him and his sister. The story evokes a feeling of failure which is, indeed, universal.\n\nWhat am I to make of my initial reaction to this book? To put it bluntly, the thought that first went through my head was: _this only won an award because they were going out of their way to be inclusive_. To be clear, I was absolutely wrong to think that; but my inability to judge Thammavongsa’s book on its own merits is a scar on my mind, caused by exactly the injustices that Castillo so effectively dismantles in her essays.",

But it feels like I’ve watched it many more times than that. It’s one of those movies where I can anticipate moments just before they happen: I can hear a line of dialogue before it’s spoken; I can see the framing of a shot before it’s cut to; I could even imitate the gestures of the actors before they moved, if I were the kind of person to fidget during movies.\n\nI’m not going to say much more about the movie itself, other than that it holds up and remains one of my favourites. Rather, I’ll use this as an opportunity to reflect on how my media-consumption habits have changed. _Inglourious Basterds_ came out in a time before streaming services and YouTube created this feeling that I always have something new to watch. Back then, I used to rewatch movies and shows (see also: [_Curb Your Enthusiasm_](/blog/2024/04/curb-your-enthusiasm)) over and over again. Even if not the whole thing, I would pick out favourite scenes to revisit; for example, the best scene of this film, the chapter in the bar featuring M. Fassbender and D. Kruger.\n\nI’m going to sound like a grumpy old man when I say this but it goes to show that less is more: _less_ choice means that you can spend _more_ time on the movies that you really love, and it’s through repeated viewings that your favourites becomes your favourites.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/inglourious-basterds/)",

		"content": "The setup of this novel reminded me of [_Past Lives_](/blog/2023/06/past-lives): the life of a married couple is disrupted by a visitor from one of the partners’ past. \n\nFrom the start, I found the couple’s behaviour to be not entirely believable: why was one partner so secretive about her past, and why was her wife so jealous about it? I kept thinking that an honest, open conversation would have diffused all of the tension between them. But, through a somewhat repetitive and long-winded exploration of their thoughts and memories, I came to a reluctant understanding: this book is a portrait of a failing relationship.\n\nI commend the novel for presenting a perspective that I don’t see often: that of a queer person living openly in a same-sex relationship, while at the same time staying closeted about her bisexuality.\n\nHowever, there were enough flaws in the story that I can’t say I recommend it. In particular, there are a couple of “plot twists” near the end that seem to serve no purpose other than to underscore a point that was already clear, and then to punish the main character. There’s also an extended exposition about the [plight of Ugandan Indians under Idi Amin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Asians_from_Uganda), and how it compares with the Syrian refugee crisis. It’s a bit discomfiting to measure traumas against each other, and I wasn’t sure what the author was getting at.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/dbd3c7bb-29f9-4a8d-ab0a-af38b59277a4)",

The philosophy of digital minimalism aims to reclaim that value by being intentional about technology.\n\nUnfortunately, the book falls short for me when it comes to how to actually achieve this outcome. In its introduction, it states that willpower and superficial lifehacks aren’t enough to break the grip that the attention economy has on us; but, the suggestions given in the book read exactly like superficial lifehacks based on willpower. His biggest idea is the _digital declutter_, which involves removing all optional technology for 30 days. But how do we do this, if not through willpower?\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/955da706-fcd2-4b30-a584-9a138c25a929)",

Everyone has to answer that for themselves, and the movie is appropriately evasive about stating a definitive opinion.\n\nIt’s almost three hours long, but it flew by for me. Not that it’s fast-paced; in fact, there are many long jargon-filled dialogue scenes, especially near the beginning, where I didn’t even know what they were talking about. But it’s riveting precisely because of this: my mind was just working so hard to convince myself I’m smart enough to understand expert music theory that I could never get bored. Of course, Cate Blanchett’s charisma helps.\n\nWhat I found most fascinating were the supernatural and almost horror-like aspects of the film. Tár is haunted by her dark deeds, and there are really mysterious scenes where this haunting becomes physically real.

Not to get too much into my personal life, but money can sometimes be a minefield in our relationship, and we were looking for suggestions.\n\nThe first part of this book didn’t really click with me, because it’s about all the pitfalls that cause people to overspend: pressure from one’s social circle (“keeping up with the Joneses”), the distortions of social media, etc. Overspending is not really a problem for us, so I couldn’t relate.\n\nBut, I can say that once the book moved into practical advice on how to manage finances, I found a lot to like. Ultimately, it led me to a new perspective on budgeting. (In the book’s rhetoric, it recommends _not_ budgeting, but really, it’s just budgeting in a different way.) To summarize:\n\n_The old way:_ we allocate a budget for expenses, and whatever’s left over is savings. The trouble is, sometimes expenses are unpredictable, so it feels like we’re taking away from our savings. Also, any sort of “fun” spending feels wrong because it’s also taking away from savings.\n\n_The new way:_ allocate a budget for predictable expenses _and_ savings. Savings are further broken down, so that the intent is clear: e.g., is it for retirement, for an emergency repair, for an upcoming big purchase? Then, whatever’s left over can be spent without worry.\n\nIt’s a subtle shift in mindset, but one that I hope will take away some of the stress and anxiety around money. I can’t say if it works yet, but maybe I’ll check back in with another post after putting it into practice.\n\n[storygraph link]()",

I’ve had [Hans Zimmer’s score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Dune_%282021_film%29) running through my head for the past two years. The [scene with the throat-singing shaman or whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEymyO5Abp4) is burned into my brain.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the storytelling difficult to get a grasp on. In each of the two parts, I enjoyed the scene-setting of the first half of the runtime. But then, as soon as the plot started to accelerate towards the end, the pacing felt both slow and rushed at the same time. I think the story is just too complicated to fit into a movie. (Maybe, just _maybe_, the early 2000’s [miniseries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B1nfv65xQY) and [its sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rBXcsk-BeE) did a better job of making the story clear, but I haven’t watched those in a long time, and I don’t trust my fond memories of it.)\n\nAt the end of the day, the feeling I’m left with the most is the desire to read the books again.\n\nletterboxd links [1](https://letterboxd.com/film/dune-2021/) [2](https://letterboxd.com/film/dune-part-two/)",

It’s especially cool how whenever the ghouls/creatures appear, only one person can see it, but everybody else in the room can see the one person’s reaction. Once this is set up, they don’t even have to show the creature anymore, and it’s still just as creepy because you’re reacting along with the others in the room.\n\nI was less engaged with the backstory of a tragic death in the family… the movie was aiming for a high level of difficulty in terms of emotional poignancy, but it felt rote to me. Suicide as a subject matter is hard to get right; it’s a fine line between treating it with empathy and using it as an exploitative plot point. One could write a whole thesis paper about when it works and when it doesn’t, and I don’t think I have it in me to get into it in a quick review like this.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/talk-to-me-2022/)",

When I say that, you might think that it leads to a tidy ending—now she’s got _two_ families!—but of course, real life is more complicated than the clichés.\n\nA memorable chapter early in the book involves a pair of Nicole’s acquaintances, who are considering adopting a child, asking her if she “minded” being adopted when she was a kid. It’s a question that assumes that the adoptee experience is monolithic, and that as long as Nicole was happy, they could be assured that their kid would be, too. The rest of the book deconstructs that idea, and shows us the messiness that lies behind everyone’s family story.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4c453718-0842-4497-9f0b-849902cc844e)",

Of course, those lives, and especially the relationships in those lives, are much more complex.\n\nThere’s a memorable flashback scene featuring one of the ugliest couple fights I’ve ever seen. They’re both writers, and they resent each other for how time is spent towards their creative pursuits. On the one hand, it’s become a pet peeve of mine for stories to feature the writing profession. (Can’t writers write about something other than writing?) But on the other hand, the feeling of not having enough time to write—and especially the temptation to blame the people in your life for it—hits pretty close to home for me.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/anatomy-of-a-fall/)",

Like that book, it’s a challenging read; my experience of it could be described as spending long stretches not really understanding what was going on, but then being knocked over every few pages by a deeply profound sentence or passage. Unlike Dillard’s work, though, Bernstein has the benefit of fiction, so that she can introduce surreal and dark elements, like the image of the protagonist as a baby, taking care of her older siblings before she could even speak; or the Ari Aster-esque cult-like imagery in the finale.\n\nAll in all, a bizarre and melancholy read. You really pity the protagonist’s constant negative self-talk. I think there’s more to it than that, though; this book would reward a closer reading than I was able to give it. \n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/4eee5848-6afc-4e04-8001-cda68ebbf16a)",

What is it like to run a TV station? How do they manage the logistics of a cruise ship? What kinds of numbers need to be crunched during a merger? We get glimpses of these things, but I guess my expectation for a workspace drama is: I want to see the _work_.

		"content": "I saw this film as part of the [TIFF Secret Movie Club](https://tiff.net/events/secret-movie-club-2023-2024) program. The screenings have that film festival feeling, because we’re seeing movies before wide release. Also, they’re often capped by a Q&A session with part of the filmmaking team. For the screening of _The Animal Kingdom_ (a.k.a. _Le Règne Animal_), we were told before the show that there’d be a recorded interview with the sound supervisor at the end. Because of this fact, I tried to tune into the auditory experience, and indeed, it’s one of the notable technical achievements of the film.\n\nIn the story, people have started to randomly mutate into Dr. Moreau-esque animal hybrids. We follow a family whose matriarch has begun this transformation, and has disappeared into the wild, while the father and son try to get her back—both in the sense of physically locating her, and in the sense of “curing” her and making her human again. The tension mounts further when the townspeople get their pitchforks ready, and further still when the boy shows signs of mutation too.\n\nThe designs of the hybrids are cool, and brought to the screen mostly by performance and prosthetics. The aforementioned sound design comes into play in the way the creatures blend their human speaking voices with animal sounds.\n\nSci-fi-grounded-in-reality is probably one of my favourite things, and I enjoyed the film on its technical achievements and plotting. However, the allegorical elements felt too broad to be effective. It only points at subjects like racism, queerness, environmentalism, without really diving into any. Honestly, it covers a lot of the same thematic ground as _X-Men_, but without the luxury of time that a long-running series affords.\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-animal-kingdom-2023/)",

Please read on!\n\n<!-- excerpt -->\n\n### An Unexpected Discovery from Japan\n\nWhen we went to Tokyo last year, we surprised ourselves by spending a disproportionate amount of time inside stationery stores. Bev and I are both nerds when it comes to stationery: she’s into the many varieties of pens, and I like paper products.\n\nAs tourists, you’d think we would visit sites that have significance to Japanese culture. But as it turns out, quality stationery _is_ a [significant part](https://youtu.be/Cq6mP-WfikI) of Japanese culture. Most malls and department stores have stationery sections, with a much more wide-ranging selection than we’re used to here in Canada. If you’ve only been to Staples or Indigo, nothing will prepare you for the 12-story [Itoya](https://whenin.tokyo/Itoya-Stationary-Ginza) in the Ginza district.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/5f43c7b0-ff92-4727-af3a-7aade62a6d79)\n\nAs mentioned, I have an affinity for notebooks, and planners in particular. What can I say, I like to stay organized the old-fashioned way. In 2023, I was using a [Leuchtturm1917 weekly planner](https://www.leuchtturm1917.ca/weekly-planner-and-notebook-english.html), and it was serviceable, but didn’t quite suit my needs. Because we visited Japan in the summer, I didn’t see many planners in stores (they’re sold towards the end of the year, for use starting in January). So when November came around, I found myself mentally travelling back to Tokyo, wishing I could see what they had to offer.\n\nThanks to online shopping, I discovered the [Hobonichi Techo]( https://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/2024/pc/detail_cover/cb24_jan_en/), and never looked back. It combines a weekly planner and a daily journal, and the page layouts are beautifully designed. The quality of [the paper](https://www.galenleather.com/blogs/news/tomoe-river-paper) is almost magical: silky smooth, able to hold fountain pen ink, but light and thin enough that I can carry its 500+ pages without feeling like I’m lugging around a Tolstoy novel.\n\nI’ve been into journalling for some time, but I never did it as often as I wanted to. With the Hobonichi’s daily format, it encourages me to write something down everyday, because there’s nothing sadder than a wasted empty page.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3be3f472-8923-4ca7-9bd5-0b443eb6dd96)\n\nLet me know: Do you use anything for day-to-day planning or journalling? Do you have any favourite pieces of stationery? (I haven’t even mentioned my favourite pen. Maybe another time.)\n\n### A “Secret” Revealed\n\nOne of the first books I read this year was [_Humankind: A Hopeful History_]( https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9a3bf034-0cec-4d40-b473-17e644f35ebf) by Rutger Bregman. Check out [my review](/blog/2024/01/humankind) for a more in-depth summary, but suffice it to say, the message of the book has been on my mind ever since I read it. I’ve really tried to adjust my perception to assume that people’s intentions are generally good.\n\nOne lesson that stuck with me is the idea that we should spread the word about our good deeds. While I don’t exactly keep it a secret, I’ve tended to avoid talking about my volunteer work. Or I might tell people, “I do it because I enjoy it,” as if its purpose is to entertain myself. I have this belief, misplaced perhaps, that charity requires humility, and that if I draw attention to my altruism, then I’m somehow being a jerk.\n\nBut according to Bregman, hiding our good deeds only reinforces the idea that people are selfish.\n\n> Modern psychologists have discovered that when people do something out of the goodness of their hearts, they often fabricate selfish motives… As one American psychologist notes, “People seem loathe to acknowledge that their behaviour may have been motivated by genuine compassion or kindness.”\n>\n> Unfortunately, this reticence works like a nocebo. When you disguise yourself as an egotist, you reinforce other people's cynical assumptions about human nature. Worse, by cloaking your good deeds, you place them in quarantine, where they can't serve as an example for others.\n>\n> - Rutger Bregman\n\nSo, I’m here to tell you a little bit about my experiences in the past year. On most weeks, I participate in the [Canadian Cancer Society’s Wheels of Hope program](https://cancer.ca/en/living-with-cancer/how-we-can-help/transportation). I pick up patients from their homes and drive them to their appointments at various hospitals. During their appointment, I wait at a nearby coffee shop, or take a walk in the park, or just have a good sit in the car. When they’re done, I take them home.\n\nAs I write this, I still have a nagging feeling that I shouldn’t be bragging. I hope it doesn't come across that way. My goal is to spread awareness, not about myself, but about the positive acts that we can do in our communities.\n\nIn that spirit, I’d like to hear about any charitable causes or volunteer work that you might be involved with.

This may be a spoiler for some, so proceed with caution.\n\n_Trust_ is divided into four parts:\n1. A novel about a wealthy New York couple who made their fortune on stocks, and weathered the [1929 crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929) so well that it’s suspected that the man manipulated the markets.\n2. A memoir written by the man on whom the novel in part one is based. He defends his wealth on the grounds that his personal gain benefits society as a whole. [Growing the pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_the_pie) and all that.\n3. Another memoir written by the ghostwriter of part two. Through her eyes, we see just how much part two was an exercise in self-aggrandizing myth-making.\n4. The unearthed private diaries of the wealthy man’s wife, who was more involved in the business than she was given credit for. \n\nMy enjoyment of this book was driven mostly by the structure and the way each section reveals a new layer of truth. It does a less extreme version of what [_Cloud Atlas_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/22fe15a2-ddc3-458f-b79c-e740fa8c3f9a) does. \n\nBut on the other hand, I didn’t really like the writing style. The first two parts are especially dry, observing the characters from a cold distance. And ultimately, the truths that the book reveal feel obvious. The wealthy can get away with anything, and women are neglected by history?

I think the purity of the score evokes the sadness that permeates the show, but distills it from the frustrations that I felt with the story.\n\nThe premise of the show is as follows: one day, in a single instant, two percent of the world’s population disappears with no trace and no explanation. The story picks up three years later, and deals with the people who are left behind. As expected, everyone is in pain. Where the show loses me is the extent to which every character is broken. I was reading the book [_Humankind_](/blog/2024/01/humankind) at the same time as I was watching _The Leftovers_, and I found it hard to swallow that the collective trauma in the show has made everyone hateful and hostile towards each other. I want to believe that people would find a way to cooperate and support each other through the darkness.",

		"content": "I would describe this film as an “artsy rom-com,” and I mean that as a compliment. I really connected to the introverted main character Fran, who struggles to insert herself into the superficialities of office social life. Fran is me: I’m certain that I, like her, have grabbed a slice of cake from the office party and left to enjoy it at my desk alone. And when a new coworker joins the team, and you have to go around the table and say a little something about yourself, I have also waited my turn in dread, and just blurted out my introduction to get it over with.\n\nBut what really makes me feel like Fran is me and I am Fran is what happens between her and this new coworker. It made me reflect that the most valuable relationships in my life have been with people who bring me out of my shell. Sometimes I find the phrase _come out of one’s shell_ to be misleading, as if once you’re out, you’re out and there’s no going back. More accurate is the continuous tense: I will _always be coming out_ of my shell, and I must appreciate the people who make it just a little bit easier.\n\n(Aside: when I was drafting this post, I omitted the last word of the title, so that anyone looking over my shoulder at my screen wouldn’t get the wrong idea, i.e. _Look at that guy… is he writing a suicide note?_ It’s a provocative title to be sure, and I was weary going in that it would be dark, but to my relief, the tone of the movie is more quirky than dreary. I wouldn’t necessarily say that Fran is suicidal, more that she wonders whether she would be missed if she were dead.)\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/sometimes-i-think-about-dying-2023/)",

		"content": "This is a short story collection centred around a single character. Therefore, I wouldn’t hesitate to accept this as a novel if it had been published as such.\n\nSoma is a character who’s been scarred in many ways by the hardships in her life: an abusive and eventually absent mother, the loss of a close friend to suicide, a break-up with someone who seemed not to respect her Jewish heritage. I appreciated the layers of character detail in this book, like Soma’s proficiency at cooking. It’s a skill she’s proud of, but at the same time, it’s a constant reminder that she had to learn how to feed herself because her mother was gone, and she had to take on the responsibility at a younger age than the average person.\n\nThe centrepiece of the book for me is the story titled “Who You Start With Is Who You Finish With,” which threads together Soma’s life and her grandmother Charna’s youth in wartime. The grandmother suffered the horror of watching the Holocaust unfold over the Atlantic, as well as the pain of being shunned by the Jewish community for marrying outside of her religion. Her cultural identity was under attack in two ways, and so when we see Soma’s efforts to celebrate her grandmother with traditional prayer, it feels like a happy ending for Charna, in a way.\n\nThere are a couple of stories in the collection which are more experimental and surreal, almost like poetry. It’s not really my thing, but your mileage may vary.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/00b1ed23-e215-46fa-a0c7-e7838cb5039a)",

		"content": "_Humankind_ by Rutger Bregman is a book that attempts to overturn the prevailing view that people are inherently selfish and malevolent. From the oft-referenced stories of the [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment) and [Kitty Genovese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese), to the everyday news, we hear a lot about the sins of humankind. Bregman dismantles these stories, arguing that they only preserve existing power and economic structures. Instead, he aims to show that we’re motivated by kindness towards others.\n\nThe book is a breezy read, filled with snappy anecdotes and factoids. It worked on me: at the beginning, I read with skepticism, trying to poke holes in his arguments; but by the end, I found everything he was saying to be obvious. Run a school without classes and lesson plans, because the students will naturally find their own path to learning? Of course! Run a prison without cells, and where the guards play games and sing songs with the inmates? Sounds like a great idea! \n\nIt was as if the book had created a new intuition in me: take everything that is considered conventional in modern society, and _do the opposite._\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9a3bf034-0cec-4d40-b473-17e644f35ebf)",

There are bombs and bombs and guns. But where the Cranberries' song is filled with anger, Anna Burns uses a more delicate touch.\n\nThe unnamed protagonist is a young woman who is being pestered \"the milkman,\" who is romantically interested in her and also happens to be a member of a paramilitary organization. The stalking alone makes for anxious reading, but the real tragedy is that she has nobody to turn to. Because they live in basically a warzone, the entire community is in a constant state of mistrust and paranoia, and her personal struggles are only seen in the context of which side of the political conflict she may or may not be on.\n\nDespite the dark story, the writing style is quirky and playful, in a way that reminds of a bit of [George Saunders](/blog/2023/07/swim-in-a-pond). There's a lot of absurdist humour, like how the parents of the protaganist's \"maybe-boyfriend\" have abandoned their family to become internationally famous ballroom dancers. I enjoyed this read, even if it does feel little bit repetitive and long-winded at times.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7a8b72ec-ab80-4549-ba2e-96100a86e356)",

I hope you've had a restful and lovely holiday season.\n\nYou might be wondering what this message is all about. Well, I've decided to try start writing a newsletter. Don't worry, I'm not trying to sell anything. This is simply an attempt on my part to be more in touch with the people in my life who are meaningful to me.\n\nMaybe you're someone who I haven't seen or spoken to in a while, or maybe you're someone that I hang out with regularly. In either case, if you know me, you probably know that I tend to keep to myself. _That Albert, he's a tough nut to crack,_ you might say. _A real closed book, that guy._ \n\nThis newsletter is my way of opening the book just a little bit.\n\n### Why a newsletter?\n\nI got this idea after listening to a podcast[^1] where they were discussing the (declining) state of social media.\n\nIt made me think back to when Facebook first became a thing. I remember thinking: _My social life will improve immediately! They've solved the problem of friendship!_\n\nMaybe I've had some fun interactions on Facebook over the years, but nowadays, using social media no longer feels like you're connecting with people. So I'm thinking, maybe good ol' fashioned e-mail, away from the ads and the algorithms, can help me keep in touch.\n\n_**If your inbox is already too full, I apologize for the intrusion. I won't be mad if you unsubscribe. But more importantly, if you have any thoughts or questions for me, or just want to say hi, hit the Reply button and send me a note. I'd love to hear from you.**_\n\n### The Actual \"Content\"\n\nThis newsletter is still an experiment, so I'm not sure what I'll be writing about. I’ll keep this first one short, and just share some pictures from our holiday season.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/953f41e9-ae6b-4507-8ba9-697e2c5d55db)\n\n### What next?\n\nIf I never send out another one of these, then I guess you can add it to the pile of failed New Year's Resolutions. But I would really like to do this again, so here are some potential topics that you might see from me in the future:\n\n- Our trip to Hong Kong and Japan this summer. I've been meaning to share my pictures, and was writing some code to show them in a cool slideshow on my website. I will try to get it done!\n- What I do as a self-employed software developer.\n- Anything else that comes to mind...\n\nThe thing that will encourage me the most to keep going with this newsletter is if I hear back from you. So, go ahead, hit Reply, and tell me how you're doing!\n\nHappy new year!\n\n\n[^1]: An interview with journalist Ezra Klein on the [_Search Engine_ podcast](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/how-do-i-use-the-internet-now)",

The show started off more as a comedy in its first season, and I felt that it shifted more towards drama as it progressed.

The main character Sabi is defined by their feelings of not knowing where they belong, and I think it's fair to say that they're not ready at this stage in their life to be in a long-term relationship.\n\nThe plotting maybe relied a bit too much on big shocking events, and didn't give the characters enough time to process them before moving onto the next twist. You could say that it's true to life, but I would have liked to see more falling action to balance out the escalations. Still, the show is a valuable lesson in empathy for people who are different.",

One standout scene is when the main character Julie crashes a party and meets Eivind, and the two flirt in escalating ways while making sure that they don't cross the line into cheating on their respective partners.\n\nIn hindsight though, I found Julie to be empty as a character (through no fault of Renate Reinsve's charismatic performance). I get that she's meant to be indecisive, and doesn't know what she wants, but that idea could have been explored. She only doesn't know what she wants given the limited set of choices that modern society presents her; but I believe that everybody wants _something_... it's the spaces _between_ the choices that make a person. Case in point, the Aksel character--who seems to be a surrogate for the writer/director, since he's all about making art--gets plenty of introspective moments. Why not give these moments to the main character?  \n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-worst-person-in-the-world/)",

The first season is quite slow, but I think the show finds its rhythm in Season 2, once Anne Boleyn becomes queen. There's also a noticeable increase in production quality in Seasons 3 and 4, as the show grows beyond interior sets and into castle courtyards and battlefields.\n\nWith historical dramas, there's a tradeoff between being factually accurate and giving the audience compelling emotional stakes. I think this show skews more towards the former; I know it's not 100% accurate, but there's still a connect-the-dots feeling that the show is covering the important dates at the cost of character development.\n\nI don't think there's much insight into the mind of Henry VIII himself. He seems to be ruled by his hormones more than anything else. The most interesting character turns out to be Henry Cavill's [Charles Brandon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Brandon,_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk). I found it compelling that he's conflicted by his relationship to the King; he's loyal, but recognizes the harm of the Henry's cruel tendencies. Cavill's performance is subtle and charismatic. Seeing this, it doesn't surprise me that he was the biggest star to come out of this cast.",

For the most part, the goal that these people are trying to ascend towards--wealth--remains an invisible spectre that hangs over them. You don't see the bosses that they're trying to please by taking smiling lessons; you don't see the VIPs that they're training as bodyguards to protect; you don't see who they're constructing the sex dolls for.\n\nI almost wish that the film that kept that limited perspective for the entire runtime, but we do see a fancy dinner with those who have ascended all the way to the top. But for them, there is a higher goal: they seem preoccupied with the Western influences of the table settings and glassware. Is the Chinese Dream really worth chasing if it just leads you into the same materialistic folly as the American Dream?\n\n[letterboxd link](https://letterboxd.com/film/ascension-2021/)",

It's easy to blame inequality on greedy wealthy people, which amplifies the divisions between people, whereas insecurity is a function of the capitalist system, and affects everyone. The reason that greed is such a powerful force is because everyone is afraid is losing it all, no matter how much they have.\n\nI'm not sure if the book really sticks to this idea, though. We get the historical background of the origins of capitalism, which is a story about barons and commoners, which brings us back around the division between haves and have-nots all over again.\n\nWhile I appreciated the historical and especially the Canadian context in this book, it felt overall like preaching to the choir. (I'm already quite the socialist.) It's also written in a somewhat academic style, which made it increasingly skimmable towards the end.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7da6daa5-590b-46fd-a66d-cc6e8a0f2a45)",

I found myself missing the specificity of time and place, and was carried through mainly by the romance between the main characters.\n\nThe second half kind of explains the vagueness of the first. Forced to flee their home, the couple travels through “doors,” literal portals that lead to other parts of the world. Unlike their origin, their destinations are named: Mykonos, London, Marin. They find themselves living amongst other refugees from all over the world.\n\nThe book rolls to a heartbreaking end as the relationship of the couple deteriorates under the pressure that all of the refugees face as a group. Despite their diverse backgrounds, the citizens of the West just see them as a single mass of unwelcome intruders. Their city was unnamed, because their identity is irrelevant to their opponents: it doesn't matter where they came from.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/6f9a394a-4f3b-445d-a346-804937bb5ffa)",

		"content": "The premise of this book tickled a morbid sense of fascination in me: it asks, _what do we do with the art of monstrous men?_ (Think Woody Allen, Kevin Spacey, Bill Cosby.)\n\nMore on that later. I actually engaged most with the book when it took a slight digression to discuss a type of \"monster\" that we don't talk about often: a mother who abandons her children to pursue art. The author wonders if parenthood is incompatible with creativity, and dares to ask if she would have been a better writer if she hadn't become a mother. Even though there's a distinct feminist slant to the book, I found myself identifying with this section as I follow my journey towards potentially becoming a father.\n\nBack to the original question: what do we do with the art of monstrous men? I wasn't sure that I really needed an answer, frankly. I'm of the opinion that there are no hard and fast rules for this kind of thing. Always strive to know the truth, and if it makes you uncomfortable, then you can choose to stop engaging with an artist's work. But on the other hand, you should still enjoy what you enjoy, as long as you acknowledge the truth, however ugly it may be.\n\nAs summed up in _Monsters_:\n\n> The way you consume art doesn’t make you a bad person, or a good one. You’ll have to find some other way to accomplish that.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a7393ec0-1b73-4334-89a6-c6ac0d74d417)",

		"description": "_Ru_, _The Breaking Ice_, _Backspot_",
		"content": "Part 2 of 2! \n\n(see [Part 1 here](/blog/2023/09/tiff-2023-1))\n\n# [_Ru_](https://letterboxd.com/film/ru-2023/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\nThis film follows the Nguyens, a family of Vietnamese refugees as they resettle in Quebec after fleeing the aftermath of their country's civil war. A lot rests on the performance of [Chloe Djandji](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm15036167/), who plays Tinh, the oldest child, and the main point-of-view character. At first, I wasn't impressed by her blank expression, but as the film proceeds to show us visually striking flashbacks of her and her family's difficult journey, I came to appreciate her stillness.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/c4713f96-2915-4f7f-9fc0-2a90c94f0648)\n\nThe rest of Tinh's family seems to be carrying on with their lives, while she remains stuck. Perhaps she alone experienced the worst of the trauma, as we see in the most memorable scene: a shocking moment where an explosion in the flashback throws debris onto the snowy schoolyard in the present.\n\nLater in the film, the Nguyens visit the home of the Quebecois sponsors who have been helping them settle in. After a big feast, they stand outside in the snow, and the hosts sing a French folk song while the Nguyens listen. The scene felt indulgent to me. It takes the spotlight away from our main characters, and it made me realize that as a whole, the film is maybe trying too hard to sanctify the Canadian characters. Their singing didn't uplift me, but rather, made me feel like the film was flirting with [\"white saviour\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film) territory.\n\n# [_The Breaking Ice_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-breaking-ice/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"4\" readonly /></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/9476eb79-9bca-418d-9a67-9210b57b6bc2)\n\n_The Breaking Ice_ by Anthony Chen takes place in the Chinese city of Yanji, which borders North Korea. As the title suggests, it's a cold place. I would never choose to go there for a vacation, but the more we explore the place through the characters' eyes, the more I saw the appeal. Although the weather is unwelcoming, or perhaps _because_ it is unwelcoming, the film feels like an escape. No one wants to be there, but our main characters _need_ to be there, because they can't stand to be anywhere else.\n\nThe trio of characters is set up to be a love triangle, but it kind of stops mattering by the end. They simply enjoy spending time together, all three, and sex is secondary to friendship. They find in each other what they can't find in more populous places: acceptance beyond the expectations of family and Chinese society.\n\nMy favourite of the year.\n\n# [_Backspot_](https://letterboxd.com/film/backspot-2023/)\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3\" readonly /></span>\n\nI attended a late-night screening, filled with young people, mainly girls. I think my viewing experience was improved by the crowd's energy as they cheered and laughed throughout.\n\nI had watched the [_Cheer_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheer_(TV_series)) docuseries about competitive cheerleading, and this film is basically a fictional version of that. It's a pretty standard sports movie, including a training montage and the inevitable build-up to the big final competition, so I will just point out a few things that stood out:\n\n- huge credit to the actors, because they are actually doing the acrobatics\n\n- the final competition is filmed in a long take, which wouldn't be possible with stunt doubles, so again, huge credit to the actors!\n\n- I enjoyed the electronic score, which was composed by the director D.W. Waterson, who is also a DJ\n\n- one of the characters works at a movie theatre, and so there's a surprising amount of Cineplex product placement, which felt even more bizarre as I was sitting in a Cineplex theatre\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/af838e3a-fe10-4855-a5b8-3178fb7182fe)\n\nWhile enjoyable, the film has one big flaw for me. Under the pressure of making the team and winning, the main character, Riley, suffers from compulsive hair-pulling and eventually panic attacks. Unfortunately, the movie fails to address these mental health issues beyond the easy trope that once you do the thing and succeed at the thing (i.e. win the cheerleading competition), then all is well and you never have to worry about it again.",

		"content": "This is part 1 of 2. I saw six films this year at TIFF, and liked all of them. Pretty good batting average.\n\n# [_Seagrass_][1]\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThe 90’s setting for this film is nicely established early on when a mother hands her two daughters a crisp Canadian $2 bill to buy ice cream. They’re riding a ferry towards a summer retreat, where the parents will attend a couples workshop to mend their troubled relationship.\n\nYou can also tell it’s the 90’s from the lack of adult supervision when the two girls play with the other kids. Being of mixed race, the sisters are treated with casual racism, like when another girl tells them “you look normal even though you’re half-Japanese.” The two child actors do an excellent job of portraying their reactions to these moments; there’s nothing to do but laugh it off, but it’s a false laugh.\n\nThe younger daughter is especially compelling. She seems to be suffering from anxiety and/or depression, and it’s appropriately painful to watch.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/56ffdf16-72a7-410c-8b43-ad93ab39ffe2)\n\nI was hoping to see more of the adults’ therapy sessions. There are only a small handful of scenes, and some are played for laughs. I’m fascinated by watching people emerge from their emotional barriers [^1], and unfortunately, I didn’t feel like I saw enough of that in _Seagrass_.\n\nThis leads to the film’s biggest flaw for me. We are watching a couple’s relationship fall apart, and it’s suggested that one of their problems is the failure of the husband to understand and respect the wife’s Japanese heritage. But we are also introduced to, in what must be an intentional contrast, a second interracial couple who seem to be doing great (and who attend these counselling sessions as a sort of maintenance program). In creating this contrast, the movie prompts us to ask, why does one couple work, but the other doesn’t? What is it specifically about the main characters that causes conflict? I didn’t feel that the film gave us enough to satisfyingly answer these questions.\n\n# [_The Contestant_][3]\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d8d6cdfa-9382-42c2-aed7-abad1e62aab0)\n\nI remember seeing a newspaper article about the subject of this documentary when I was in high school. A popular Japanese TV show (_Susunu! Denpa Shonen_[^2]) was airing a regular segment wherein a young man was locked alone in a room, and had to apply to magazine sweepstakes in order to win prizes to feed himself. He would only be released after he won the equivalent of one million yen in prizes. By the way, he was naked the whole time. The newspaper article was funny to me, in a _hey-isn’t-Japan-wild?_ kind of way, and I brought the newspaper to school to show my friends.\n\nThis documentary is a gripping look behind the scenes of the show. We get interviews with the man, who’s known as Nasubi, and with the producer of the show. It’s certainly a much darker story than what was reported at the time. The original show was mainly played for laughs, and Nasubi’s natural goofy charisma must have been entertaining to viewers at the time. But he reveals in retrospect that he was depressed and suicidal. The way the documentary is edited, it’s hardly surprising that he struggled mentally; what he went through amounted to torture. But that’s exactly the power of film editing: the original TV show made it look like he was having a good time.\n\n_The Contestant_ works well while it’s covering the actual events of _Denpa Shonen_. As a viewer, you don’t know whether to laugh or be angry. But I wished that it had more to say about the deeper ethical implications of what happened. The producer of the show basically gets to laugh it off, saying that he was just obsessed with making the best show he could. There’s no apology, no contrition. Nasubi for his part seems to have simply gotten over it. The documentary attempts to present his recent mountain climbing efforts as a redemptive end, but I think it’s a case of real life not providing the sense of justice and closure that we as viewers want.\n\n# [_Sweet Dreams_][4]\n\n<span><sl-rating value=\"3.5\" readonly /></span>\n\nThis is a story about colonialism in Indonesia in the early 1900’s. The Dutch owner of a sugar farm dies suddenly, and leaves behind the question of who will succeed him: his adult son who has travelled from the Netherlands to pick up the pieces, or the young child who resulted from an affair with the Indonesian housekeeper?\n\nI didn’t realize this was a comedy until 15 minutes in, when a letter-writing montage is accompanied by a jaunty orchestral score that is [abruptly cut off][5] by a door opening. To be fair, the film walks the line between tragedy and comedy. The scenes about the exploited Indonesian workers are more realistic and subdued, and their plight is punctuated by comedic scenes at the expense of the wealthy white foreigners. (A subtle gag involves the pregnant wife of the landowner’s son, whose face gets increasingly blotchy with mosquito bites as the film goes on.) These scenes reminded me of the sardonic tone of [_Triangle of Sadness_](/blog/2023/06/triangle-of-sadness).\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/cc4ff21d-68aa-4d98-8e90-0e0a4cbef5c0)\n\n_(spoilers ahead)_\n\nThe final 15 minutes or so are mostly silent, and contains some surreal dream imagery. I had trouble understanding what was going on when I was watching it, but upon reflection, I think it comes down to the impossible choice that the housekeeper is forced into making. She can either leave behind everything she knows so that her son can have access to the wealth that was extracted from them, or she can live a modest life with her community. At first, she chooses the latter, which _feels_ like the morally right decision; but soon, we learn that violence is built into the system of colonialism, and that her freedom to choose was illusory. She’s left with no other option but to burn it all down.\n\n[^1]:\tI’m a big fan of the show [_Couples Therapy_][2], for example.\n\n[^2]:\tTranslation: _Do not proceed!

But somehow, I felt like the third wheel for most of the trip because the two of them were both much more talkative than me, and I sort of disappeared from the conversation.\n\nOf course, they might have both felt like the third wheel, too.\n\nThe graphic novel _Roaming_ perfectly captures this experience of spending a short, intense period of time as a trio. Set during a trip to New York City, the three characters each have moments of feeling like the outsider to the other two. Relationships are ultimately defined in pairs, but one can't possess another fully, even though we sometimes want to.\n\n[storygraph link](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/3ecb69ed-ab7e-4d9a-8f93-0f4a44ece338)",

		"content": "_Trader_ is a one-person, single-location thriller.[^1] As such, the discussion must begin with actor Kimberly-Sue Murray, who carries the film with chameleon-like confidence. The character is all about deception and manipulation, as she puts on a different accent for each of the conversations she has with the other characters over the phone. With hair, makeup, and body language changes, she sometimes looks like a different person from scene to scene.\n\nAnother strength of the film is the visual design and propulsive editing. It all takes place in a dingy basement apartment, so there’s not much physically for the filmmakers to work with, but using creative lighting and mixing in a generous dose of [screenlife][2] shots, they are able to create a whole world, which feels like it’s always in motion.\n\nI had trouble with the morality of the film, which I’m sure is the point. It seems to say that the only way to survive in a horrible world (i.e., the world of stock market finance, and more broadly, capitalism) is to be even more horrible.[^2] The film in its final moments makes <sup>_(click for spoiler)_</sup> <span class=\"spoiler\" x-data=\"spoiler\" x-bind=\"attrs\">a mass shooting</span> seem triumphant, and I really can’t go there with it.\n\n[letterboxd link][4]\n\n[^1]:\tSee also: [_Locke_][1]\n\n[^2]:\tSee also: [_Emily the Criminal_][3]\n\n[1]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/locke/\n[2]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenlife\n[3]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/emily-the-criminal/\n[4]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/trader-2022/",

The forced exile and internment of Japanese-Canadians during WWII was a shameful event, and deserves to be carved into the literary record. However, as a novel, I was not able to engage with it.\n\nTo me, the narrative voice feels both too distant and too close. It begins from the adult Naomi’s memory of her childhood, resulting in a lot of “I was a child then, and I don’t remember/didn’t understand what was going on.” Then it transitions to a long epistolary section, with Aunt Emily narrating the period leading up to their family’s relocation, which has a lot of “Everything is chaos, I don’t know what’s going on.” And when we shift to Naomi’s first-hand experiences in the Slocan encampment, it becomes overly descriptive, focussing on too many details of the surrounding forest.\n\nI know all of this is meant to evoke Kogawa’s subjective experiences, but I felt that the story might have been better served with a more objective and consistent narrative style.

		"description": "Or, Blogger Reacts to the Time-Wasting Power of the YouTube Algorithm",
		"content": "Before my recent trip to Japan, I became obsessed with a [YouTube video][1] featuring a Japanese dance group called Avantgardey, auditioning on _America’s Got Talent_. I enjoyed their quirky choreography (which includes pulling funny faces), and watched the video repeatedly, thinking that it would be a good way to immerse myself in the “Japanese soul” before my trip.\n\nIt was, in retrospect, pretty mild, as obsessions go. I checked out some of their other performances and hummed the backing track from their routine for a couple of days. Little did I know that I would soon experience a much deeper obsession.\n\nWe all know that the YouTube algorithm, for better or worse, figures out what you like, and keeps giving you more. I started seeing more _AGT_ content in my feed, including this:\n\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wyb0ExKOE4w?si=1w74AwKZTdlFE-qX\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\nThe singer Putri Ariani comes from Indonesia, where she won her country’s version of _Got Talent_ when she was only eight years old. The first time I watched her _America’s Got Talent_ audition, I recognized that she was an accomplished singer, but I didn’t think about it much.\n\nI think what brought me back the next day was Simon Cowell’s reaction: “[My… _GOD!_][2]” It was funny to me to see the normally unflappable man be so thoroughly flapped, and I thought, “Let’s see that again.” This first rewatch was the first time I cried.\n\nThere’s something about Putri’s voice that transmits emotion. Her technique is so dynamic that we subconsciously anticipate each line to see what vocal variations she’ll throw at us next. She plays the audience as much as she plays the keys of the piano.\n\nCoincidentally, I caught a cold around this time, and let myself rest for a couple days. With not much to do in bed, I let the algorithm keep feeding me content. At first, it was other _AGT_ auditions… but none of them touched me the same way that Putri’s did. I kept revisiting her audition video to get the same feeling. When I walked around the house sniffling, my wife thought it was due to my illness, but it was really because I was crying every time I watched it.\n\nThe algorithm seemed to know what I was going through, and pivoted to recommendating videos in the “Reacts” genre. In a typical “Reacts” video, we see a webcam shot of a YouTube personality (the “reactor” for lack of a better term), as they watch another video, and share their thoughts along the way.[^1] [^2]\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d6e2806c-e147-4fcd-bb3c-47017cb8a70c)\n\nPutri’s audition went viral, and dozens (hundreds?) of “Reacts” videos sprung up. Some of the reactors don’t say much, letting their facial expressions do the talking. Others are vocal coaches or music professionals, and they offer insight into the vocal techniques that Putri demonstrates.[^3] I probably spent hours watching these videos in a groggy, medicated state.\n\nOf course, if I hadn’t been sick, and was actually busy with stuff, I might not have fallen into this particular rabbit hole. I’m trying to understand what exactly hooked me in. I’ve liked many musicians before, but I’ve never immersed myself in a single performance non-stop for two days straight.\n\nSome definitions of addiction are explained in terms of the chemical [dopamine][7]. I hear it often in the context of games and gamification: whether an app is designed to be fun, or to turn an unpleasant chore into a game, it doles out mini-rewards in the form of bells, points, or visual animations. These rewards give the user a “dopamine hit,” a feeling of pleasure that keeps them coming back for more.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/adfb528b-9692-46ca-a080-b9b123ede51f)\n\nI’ve been hooked on enough video games to know what this means. When you win a match, or complete a mission, or solve a puzzle, you get this feeling of “just one more.” And when you lose, you want to try again, to redeem yourself. Either way, you’re chasing that next injection of pleasure into your brain. I’ve watched the classic film [_Trainspotting_][8] many times (probably too often and at too young an age), and while I don’t want to make light of the real and brutal consequences of heroin addiction, I can identify with how the drive to “score,” whether it comes in the form of a literal injection of drugs, or from a virtual interaction on a screen, can black out nearly everything else.\n\nPutri’s audition moved me, and I found myself wanting to experience that feeling over and over again. But I knew that if I just kept rewatching it, I would eventually tire of it. The algorithm, however, figured out another way to hook me. Reaction videos add another layer of variation, preventing the original video from becoming stale.\n\nAs I became more and more familiar with Putri’s performance, I came to know which sections would evoke the reactors’ reactions. When she hits a big note, or a particularly expressive phrase—my favourite being the way she sings “[sad, sad situation][9]” in her cover of Elton John’s “Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word”—I anticipate the response from the reactor. They might put a hand to their mouth or heart, or shake their head in disbelief, or go “Oh!” They might even get teary-eyed. And when they do, I get that little emotional release, that little dopamine hit. It’s like I’m vicariously having the experience of watching the audition for the first time.\n\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/1eab1ff1-c1c1-416d-80db-429f60d6b41e)\n<small>From [First Time Hearing Putri Ariani | \"GOLDEN BUZZER Simon Cowell\" | AGT 2023 REACTION](https://youtu.be/8dxYdi4sH7w)</small>\n\nIn total, I must have watched dozens of reaction videos. On the day that I embarked on my trip, I found myself jumping onto the airport wi-fi to see if any new ones had appeared in the YouTube feed. Travelling is a great way to detox from being overly online, but after my long days of sightseeing, I still spent a few minutes in the hotel room to get my Putri fix. The two songs that she performed in the audition must have set a record for the length of time that a piece of music has been stuck in my head. It’s been more than a month.\n\nPutri Ariani will perform live on _AGT_ next week on September 5. I can’t wait, and I wish her the best of luck.\n\n[^1]:\tFor example, and I’m just making this up, “_Pastry Chef Reacts to Behavioural Psychologist’s SHOCKING thesis defence_”\n\n[^2]:\tA format similar to this genre, I discovered during my trip, has become a staple of Japanese broadcast TV. It seems not enough for the Japanese people to just watch a thing; they must also see a picture-in-picture (a.k.a. the “[wipe][3]”), inside which one of a panel of hosts laughs or smiles or expresses surprise. I watched an entire feature-length documentary about the [Thai cave rescue][4], accompanied by open-mouthed faces in the corner of the screen.\n\n[^3]:\tA couple of my favourites:\n\t- [Opera Singer Reaction (& Analysis) - PUTRI ARIANI (Golden Buzzer Performance | AGT 2023)][5]\n\t- [Vocal Coach Reaction (& Analysis) to PUTRI ARIANI receiving the Golden Buzzer | AGT 2023][6]\n\n[1]:\thttps://youtu.be/09pXOmUpO10\n[2]:\thttps://youtu.be/Wyb0ExKOE4w?t=519\n[3]:\thttp://www.accessj.com/2012/02/wipe-that-picture-in-corner-on-tv.html\n[4]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tham_Luang_cave_rescue\n[5]:\thttps://youtu.be/PH70G8Z1OlQ\n[6]:\thttps://youtu.be/T17t0LoPqD4\n[7]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Drug_addiction_and_psychostimulants\n[8]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/trainspotting/\n[9]:\thttps://youtu.be/Wyb0ExKOE4w?t=460",

What fascinated me was the scientific and technological developments in creating the bomb.

Instead, it’s more concerned with the question of whether he is a Communist. On a script level, I respect the interweaving timelines, framed through hearings and interrogations, because I know it’s difficult to pull off. But I kind of wish the movie had been less complex, and more deliberately paced, so that we could a) see the science happen, and b) sit with the moral questions that it raises.\n\nP.S.

		"description": "The inaugural Japanese In-Flight Film Festival",
		"content": "I just got back from a trip to Japan. I hope to write more about my experiences over the coming days, but I wanted to start with my thoughts on the Japanese films that I watched during the flights to and from the country.\n\nBefore I dive in, just a quick note on how I typically “program” my in-flight entertainment. This might sound odd, but I usually don’t want to watch anything that I think I’ll love. The tiny screen and the bodily discomfort caused by [cramped seating][1] make for a suboptimal viewing experience, and I feel it would ruin a good movie if I can’t give it the best of my attention. But I don’t want to watch anything truly terrible either; even airplane time is not worth wasting on crap. My non-Japanese choices satisfied this Goldilocks requirement: [_Shazam! Fury of the Gods_][2], [_Black Adam_][3], [_65_][4], [_Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)_][5], [_Legion of Super-Heroes_][6]. (Yes, you can always count on DC for just the right level of mediocrity.)\n\nBecause I wanted to enhance my experience of Japanese culture, I made an exception and chose three Japanese films, knowing that I ran the risk of seeing a great film in a not-great environment.\n\n# [_Anime Supremacy!_][7]\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/6dd83540-d830-4610-b159-1c93dcd927a0)\n\nOf the three, I liked this one the least. The story follows a rookie anime director making her first TV series. But, uh-oh: her show happens to run in the same timeslot as the new show by the “genius” director that inspired her to become an artist. Competing with her hero is her main motivation, but the conflict felt outdated in the age of streaming. Do timeslots and ratings even matter anymore?\n\nWhat I enjoyed was the warm fuzzy feeling that comes when a creative team—producers, voice actors, animators, CG artists—pulls together to follow the director’s vision, even if it means pulling an all-nighter in a time crunch. I acknowledge that this is not realistic, as [recent][8] [news][9] stories have shown, but it's nice to fantasize that people can work together without power imbalances and inequality, right?\n\n# [_Yowamushi Pedal: Up the Road_][10]\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/0ee26ef3-7cbe-45bf-aed5-b76cc6ab0307)\n\nThis is a live-action adaptation of a manga and anime about a high-school cycling team. There are two major set pieces involving bicycle racing, and they’re both impressive. It appears that the actors are riding for real and going fast. I thought the final race was particularly cool since it shows team strategies, like riding in formation to reduce air resistance, or surrounding another team to limit their movement. I know nothing about bike racing, but I totally understood what they were doing, and that’s a credit to the visual storytelling of the film.\n\nI was less impressed with the character development, which is conveyed mainly through internal voiceover monologues, e.g. _“I’m riding for my friends! They’re counting on me! I never had friends before! Now I finally fit in!”_ I think this is pretty conventional for anime and manga aimed at a teenage audience, but I find it corny.\n\n# [_Yudo: The Way of the Bath_][11]\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/308ad3fe-1a5f-4cc7-8607-d8af87cb57a5)\n\nA quirky and charming comedy about a bathhouse, and the community that forms around it. My favourite scenes involve a character who attends a “workshop” with a master who teaches the art of bathing. It’s such a silly idea, but presented in such a serious tone (as if it were a martial art), that I was laughing but at the same time questioning whether it was disrespectful to laugh. The Japanese really do perform staid rituals for seemingly mundane things (like drinking tea), and I could believe that a rigid system of bathing would actually exist.\n\nAnother memorable character is a hard-to-please bathhouse critic (think Anton Ego, the restaurant critic in _Ratatouille_), who stands by a strict rule that only natural springs are acceptable, and bathhouses with artifically heated water are not “proper” bathhouses at all. I watched this movie on the flight into Japan, and I spent the next few days at hotels with bathhouses, but only one of which was geothermally heated. And I have to say… this critic character, even though he’s a caricacture and a villain, such as it is… he was _right_.\n\n[1]:\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXjU4l5wrkk\n[2]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/shazam-fury-of-the-gods/\n[3]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/black-adam/\n[4]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/65/\n[5]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn/\n[6]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/legion-of-super-heroes/\n[7]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/anime-supremacy/\n[8]:\thttps://www.theverge.com/2023/6/23/23771199/across-the-spider-verse-working-conditions-phil-lord\n[9]:\thttps://www.wired.com/story/marvel-vfx-unionization-big-deal/\n[10]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/yowamushi-pedal-up-the-road/\n[11]:\thttps://letterboxd.com/film/yudo-the-way-of-the-bath/",

What’s cool is that you get great writing from the stories, and then you get great writing about why it’s great, from Saunders.\n\nI only hope that I’m able to apply the lessons learned here to my own writing. I think my biggest takeaway is the idea of ambiguity: inexperienced writers like myself have the tendency to try to make a clear point in their writing, whereas the strength of these stories is their openness to be interpreted in many ways. That’s probably a lesson that I knew before, but it comes through so much brighter here under Saunders’s guidance.\n\n[storygraph link][1]\n\n[1]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fec004e1-7319-4323-b19e-9cd9dc4e855a",

There’s a tragedy and a secret hanging over the core characters, and I thought there was enough drama there without the extra mystery of the machine. We don’t find out enough about what the cards really mean to make it compelling; perhaps the pressure to set up a second season forced them to drag out the plot.",

It’s also cool to geek out with the layers of self-reference: we see scenes from the film-within-a-film, along with real footage from the original silent film, along with re-enactments of the production of the original silent film. Oh, I forgot to mention: _Irma Vep_ itself is a remake of a film, and we see scenes from that film spliced in here as well. Throw in some unexpected supernatural turns and the scenery of Paris, and it adds up to a fun, chill, occasionally mind-bending watch.\n\n[1]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Vampires",

		"content": "When I attended the University of Waterloo 20-ish years ago, all of the Computer Science undergrads, myself included, feared the so-called \"Big 3,\" courses that were so hard as to drive students mad: **Real-time Programming**, **Compilers**, and **Computer Graphics**. \n\nWhen it came time to select my courses for fourth year, I knew I wanted to try one of them. I had a friend who dreamed of one day working on video games, so we decided to take the Graphics course together.\n\nThe final project involved creating a [ray tracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)). After feverishly writing code for weeks, and a lot of time waiting for images to render, the final submission took the form of an image gallery. I remember being very proud of what I'd made. I still have all of the files, and there's no point keeping them hidden in the digital attic, so here I present my final project for CS488.\n\n(Aside: the thumbnail image for this post that you see above was AI-generated by Stable Diffusion using the prompt: _a cow carved out of wood, 3d render_.)\n\n----\n\n## New primitives\n\nNew cylinder and cone primitives were created.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/cdd5c8ce-84c5-4eaf-a5ed-f382a62e31fd)\n\nThe radius and height of the primitives can be adjusted to create a variety of shapes.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/253f9b97-847e-47dc-954e-ce105911f75c)\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/e08ad6d8-8e44-4a01-8d45-b1f105058677)\n\n</div>\n\n## Reflections\n\nThis image shows reflections.

The noise functions can be used to achieve many types of textures:\n\n### Pure noise\n\n\"Pure\" noise gives a sort of dirty look to the texture. Different values for the persistence parameter achieves varying levels of noisiness.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4490f01c-9ae3-4f9b-b48e-252637dd973b)\n<small>Persistence 0.2</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/97e515c4-faf9-41bc-bbdb-ce5c53994c0b)\n<small>Persistence 0.5</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/55ed9213-6446-44b6-b991-d1324cba77c4)\n<small>Persistence 0.8</small>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nI have implemented Perlin noise to allow flexibility in the colours that the texture is made of. Here is an example of using different colours:\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/12ac62df-c541-4844-a18f-2351a6cba36c)\n\n### Wood grain\n\nPerlin noise can be used to generate wood grain textures. Wood textures work best with low values for persistence; otherwise, the grain is much too chaotic.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/50597b98-15f5-4c14-a723-398d03f4fecc)\n<small>Persistence 0.1</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/2e1fd60e-679f-43d0-987f-7c247f55b3d1)\n<small>Persistence 0.2</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/c9d60614-b997-4c6c-9857-430baac54458)\n<small>Persistence 0.5 - It's starting to get ugly</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/337bd4cb-e048-4ffc-94f7-84c254f25740)\n<small>Persistence 0.8 - Does not look like wood anymore</small>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nWe can still specify colours for wood grain textures. So, it is possible to create this \"psychedelic\" wood:\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/8d0a058f-a9b7-4861-aa73-43f98ad302f9)\n\n### Marble\n\nMarble textures can be created with Perlin noise. Marble looks best with high values of persistence. Also, it looks most natural if the two colours of the texture are close in shade.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/c06c3d6e-5f17-457f-87e2-1ab90692bf51)\n<small>Persistence 0.3 - This doesn't look like marble yet</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/bf650447-99bc-4f9d-ba00-c0f42c591848)\n<small>Persistence 1.0 - Better</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/447c4dec-7400-4037-a6e5-5f9292e6e0a5)\n<small>Persistence 1.3 - (Arguably) better still</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/9c803971-9c2f-4102-97f5-de4cf6ec6a7b)\n<small>Persistence 1.8 - Too chaotic</small>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nPerlin noise can be applied to all primitives, as demonstrated here.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/595815d3-0f63-4df8-b1f0-794f90868f4f)\n\nIt is very difficult to texture map an arbitrary 2-dimensional image to an arbitrary 3-dimensional shape.  However, since Perlin noise is defined in 3 dimensions, it is possible to texture map complex polygonal meshes with noise.  Here, we see a mesh model textured mapped with wood grain and marble textures.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/abd6352d-6124-4db4-8c3e-23a0cbcc5b15)\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/474682c6-ae69-4dd6-8983-832c86a2b41c)\n\n</div>\n\n## Soft Shadows\n\nSoft shadows can be created using area lights.  Area lights can be partially blocked by objects, which gives the shadow a penumbra and umbra.\n\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/b384101f-0dd4-4147-a9ce-28daca5fa143)\n<small>\nFor comparison, this is what a \"hard\" shadow looks like, as created by a single point light source.\n</small>\n\nArea lights are specified as an n x n array of lights.  The larger the value of n, the better the shadow will look.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/df7814d4-257b-401f-adfb-f99da84a5ba6)\n<small>2 &times; 2 area light</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/06f00264-00fd-4576-865b-b3fd6758587e)\n<small>5 &times; 5 area light</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3a9cc221-939e-47be-a90d-171f284260e6)\n<small>10 &times; 10 area light</small>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThe size of the light can also be changed.  Larger lights cast softer shadows, and smaller lights cast harder shadows.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/b18618e0-d6a6-48ed-84e6-30c403ddb2c5)\n<small>A small area light looks almost like a point light source.</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/f96e252d-c4c2-48be-8836-e5b439db12db)\n<small>A large area light casts an extremely blurry shadow.</small>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nThe size of the light can vary in either direction.  Compare these two images: one is a \"wide\" light, and the other is a \"tall\" light.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/227dbecc-7e8c-4a1f-9b10-1f88b155a3c4)\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/1b5766d6-6558-4a86-bb93-7edb1d6069e8)\n\n</div>\n\n## Glossiness\n\nGlossy reflections are accomplished by distributing a reflection among many reflection rays.  The more reflection rays there are, the better the reflection will look.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/db324dec-312e-445e-a26a-6cc46bab91cb)\n<small>For comparison, this is a pure, non-glossy reflection.</small>\n\nThe following sequence shows the effect of increasing the number of rays.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/94388280-2e70-4a70-91ba-34ef15c68bd3)\n<small>2 reflection rays</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/1bdd1319-3427-4f6e-abc1-105b3bb49dca)\n<small>10 reflection rays</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3d89de11-0e32-4a9a-aca9-f3b2f9f8a387)\n<small>50 reflection rays</small>\n</div>\n</div>\n\nWe can control how scattered the reflection rays are.  This is determined by the specular reflection coefficient of the material.  The higher the specular coefficient, the sharper the reflection.\n\n<div class=\"responsive-gallery tw-not-prose\">\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/e200612c-837a-4980-9db8-54e2ea8bf966)\n<small>Specular coefficient 10</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/b01a2a71-e9b6-4c08-a61a-684e52814316)\n<small>Specular coefficient 40</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/3f38edab-ede4-49a1-964a-3e0c9c5435dd)\n<small>Specular coefficient 70</small>\n</div>\n\n<div>\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/fef5a696-f5e4-4853-b4fa-755142de7b52)\n<small>Specular coefficient 100</small>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Final Scene\n\nMy final scene depicts a pool room.  Texture mapping is used for most of the objects, most obviously on the walls, and in the painting.  The frame of the table is texture-mapped with wood grain generated from Perlin noise.  Notice also that the surface of the table is not completely uniform in colour; this was also accomplished with Perlin noise.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/412d8240-1484-4ca2-bdc2-ece794c736dd)\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/74daecee-8cb0-48e7-9863-374318564da7)\n<small>Homemade texture for the balls</small>\n\nThis is a close-up rendering of the table which more clearly displays the reflectiveness of the balls.  Also, area lights were used to render this scene.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d7bfeef8-cba7-4ec4-9296-c10a9f66d04e)",

When the _Rebuild_ series started in the early 2010’s, promising a more accessible and clearer story, I watched the first film and decided to wait for the rest before bingeing them together. A decade later, the series is complete and I finally revisited this world.\n\nIt kind of felt like one step forward, two steps back for me: while this version does explain some plot elements earlier, it also adds so many new ideas that the net result is just as confusing as the original series. I’m also not a huge fan of the CG “2.5-D” animation style, especially in the latter two movies, which just looked like a fluid simulation exercise at times.\n\nOverall, I think it’s skippable… better to just rewatch the original series.",

No offense to samurai.\n\nSeason 2, on the other hand, is much more diverse. I’m glad they expanded the palette to include animation studios from around the world. A highlight was “Screecher’s Reach”, with its painterly animation style, and horror-like journey into a dark cave.",

		"description": "Weird 80's Flex",
		"content": "Recently, I picked up a book called [_Loose Cannons, Red Herrings, and Other Lost Metaphors_][2] by Robert Claiborne, apparently containing etymologies of words and phrases. I’ll say nothing further about the book itself, because I haven’t read it yet, but while I was flipping through it, something caught my eye on the Acknowledgements page.\n\nThe first half of the Acknowledgements is the standard “thank the editor, I love my family” type of thing. The second half, though… well, I’ll just quote it.\n\n(Oh, important to note: this book was first published in 1988.)\n\n> The manuscript for this work was written on a Kaypro 4 microcomputer, using the Perfect Writer (Version 1.20) word-processing program, with Plu\\*Perfect and Smartkey II enhancements. The printout was made on a Silver-Reed EXP 550, linked to the computer through a Quadram Microfazer 64K buffer. The master list of metaphors from which I worked was alphabetized with SORT, a public domain program given to me by M.E. Thornsberry of San Antonio, Texas.\n\n The author must have been a computer geek, eager to show off his technological _bona fides_. I got a kick out of it, and then proceeded to fall into a rabbit hole of looking up all of these gadgets that I’d never heard of.\n\nHere’s what I found out:\n\n### Kaypro 4 microcomputer\n\nKaypro was one of the top personal computer manufacturers in the 80’s, but eventually went away once IBM and its clones took over. The Kaypro 4 of 1984 is not to be confused with the Kaypro IV, which came out a year earlier. [According to Wikipedia][3], “Kaypro's nomenclature was odd, with the numerical designations for their machines having more to do with the capacity of the drives than the order they were produced.”\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/489ac2ab-5912-4a02-840e-daeaa2a4c3e6)\n\n### Perfect Writer\n\nA word processor that was descended from another piece of software called [MINCE][4], which itself was descended from the legendary (and still-kicking) [Emacs][5]. In classic geek style, the acronym MINCE playfully stands for “MINCE is Not Complete Emacs.”\n\nI was really curious about what the “Plu\\*Perfect” and “Smartkey II” enhancements did, but couldn’t find anything on the subject.\n\n### Quadram Microfazer\n\nApparently, this is a thing that you hook up between a computer and printer, which provides extra memory. Back then, if you had to print something big, it would tie up your computer while you waited for the pages to come out. With the Quadram Microfazer, you could send the document to the device, and then work on something else instead. According to [this review][6] published in 1983,\n\n> One article I wrote recently was 4178 words long. A double-spaced printed version ran 17 pages and took 11 minutes and 40 seconds to print (about 40 seconds per page) on an Epson MX-80 printer… On the three printouts of this article, the MicroFazer saved 35 minutes of computer time, a significant saving indeed.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/dc062d93-d480-45e6-9c34-e1aea7ef6262)\n\n### Silver-Reed EXP 550\n\nCan’t you just hear the noise that this printer would make?\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/2a975f4b-c578-4d4b-9e49-d17eae315429)\n\nWhen I Googled “Silver-Reed,” a bunch of typewriters came out, along with… knitting machines. I believe the typewriters were made by the same company as the printer, which is a sensible pivot to make. Indeed, if you look at the logos, the typography matches.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/88ce4290-672b-4ed1-8116-3be67e48463a)\n\nI thought the knitting machines might also be made by the same manufacturer, because the punch-card knitting patterns make it seem computer-y, but it doesn’t look like the typography matches here.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/1d863362-118f-49c7-a640-2e4f5cd112a3)\n\nIn any case, enjoy this [cool video][7] of the knitting machine in action!\n\n### M.E. Thornsberry\n\nI couldn’t find anything about this person. They and their `SORT` program are lost to time. Rest well, M.E. Thornsberry.\n\n[2]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9eeaa732-0e04-49f8-88f5-daea68ab1a75\n[3]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro#Kaypro_by_model_and_year\n[4]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINCE\n[5]:\thttps://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\n[6]:\thttps://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v9n3/64_Quadram_MicroFazer_Data_B.php\n[7]:\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfmbFDTY5eQ",

		"description": "Jekyll → Gatsby → SvelteKit → Astro",
		"content": "I’ve written before about the tools I’ve used for building this website. To recap, I started with [Jekyll][1], and I transitioned to [Gatsby][2] because of... [reasons][3].\n\nI don’t have strong opinions about Gatsby. Being a React-based framework, it felt familiar because I had been working on several other React projects. Maybe a little _too_ familiar, as it turns out.\n\nI started to hear about [Svelte][4] and [SvelteKit][5] early last year. Curiosity got the better of me, and I decided to port this site to SvelteKit. Recall that my primary motivation for switching to Gatsby was to allow me to use [Tailwind][6] as my styling solution, and I stuck with Tailwind for my SvelteKit rewrite.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/ac224a0f-b8da-43cf-bde9-cc83666a87df)\n\nSvelte is absolutely lovely. I love its syntax for expressing reactive UI state changes, and its use of _[stores][7]_ for cross-component shared state. SvelteKit, though, I still have some reservations about. I won’t get into specifics here, because I acknowledge that it’s a relative newcomer (still in beta when I first picked it up), and I have faith that as it matures, it will continue to address some of the quirks that I encountered. If I were to start a web application project, I would choose SvelteKit.\n\nHowever, for a non-interactive blog website like this one, I don’t think that SvelteKit is the best fit. Its default mode is full-stack server-side rendering, not static site generation[^1]. In particular, it doesn’t have built-in support for content management (which Jekyll and Gatsby do), and I found myself writing a lot of custom code just to read Markdown text files from the filesystem and render it as HTML.\n\nI’ve learned that my Kryptonite is getting bogged down in coding details and missing the big picture, and after stepping back from all of the SvelteKit and Tailwind tinkering, I had a painful realization: this website was kind of _ugly_. _**Design is a skill that I need to practice, just as much as coding.**_\n\n## Jekyll → Gatsby → SvelteKit → Astro\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/f86e70f4-5399-4296-87f8-fce5c6ebe455)\n\nThis is the part of the story where I wag my finger at myself and say, “Don’t tell me you rewrote it _again_.” I’ve had enough corporate software experience to instinctively recoil at the idea. Refactoring or rewriting a project even _once_ is _verboten_, let alone three times.\n\nThat’s right, _three_. I’m now building this site using [Astro][9].\n\nIn order to describe what I’m appreciating about Astro, I need to talk about a couple of mental shifts that I’ve had in recent months.\n\n## Regarding Tailwind\n\nI called Tailwind “[CSS without CSS][10]” and to many, that’s a good thing. I fell in love with it, too, but the longer I spent with it, the more uncomfortable I got.\n\nThe initial appeal came from the feeling of “moving fast”: there’s an almost Zen-like trance that comes from typing short, easy-to-remember nubbins in the class list of an HTML element. But as soon as I needed to change something, it became tedious to scan that same list, as it got longer and longer. Many Tailwind [detractors][11] [criticize][12] it on this [front][13].\n\nMore importantly,  I started to think that maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to try to do CSS without CSS. There’s value in accepting CSS for what it is, instead of trying to hide it behind shortcuts for the sake of “developer experience.” \n\n**_Tailwind is to CSS as Coles Notes[^2] are to Shakespeare._** Why not just study Shakespeare?\n\n## Anti-JS sentiment\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/aacff7fc-1521-4405-879f-6db42de416ed)\n\nRecently, I read a couple of [blog][14] [posts][15] that angrily criticize the current state of web development. While their tone is too “conspiracy theory rant” for my tastes, they have a valid point. Namely, Javascript web frameworks (especially React) may have become dominant because of marketing and hype, not technical merit. And the consequence of putting Javascript first? A lot of extra load on browsers, and a lot of extra complexity in the development workflow.\n\nI learned React by starting two projects at around the same time: one for an internal web tool at the software company where I was employed, and one for a small-business client with whom I was moonlighting as a freelancer. It didn’t feel like I had a choice. I felt pressure from my teammates at the software company to use React, probably because they hoped that their peripheral exposure to it would result in a line item on their résumé. Even my small-business client, who has little technical knowledge, wanted me to use React. It’s a brand, and it has brand recognition in the marketplace of web development.\n\nReact appears to be easy to learn. The basic idea of rendering the DOM as a function of state is cool. However, in my experience, the basic idea is not enough to create applications that perform well and are easy to maintain. There are layers and layers of extensions and techniques[^3] that I had to learn along the way, usually because I was reacting[^4] to a situation where something was broken or slow.\n\n**_The best practices are not built in_**, and I feel like every project team needs to take a different journey towards making their application the best that it can be.\n\n## Back to basics\n\nThe web started with HTML and CSS, and I have been feeling a desire to go back to basics, and really grasp the fundamentals again.\n\nFor the longest time, I’ve held onto the presumption that CSS doesn’t have the concept of variables. That’s why, in order to make your code reusable, you needed to use a [preprocessor][21], or [one][22] [of][23] [many][24] CSS-in-JS solutions. But in fact, browsers have supported CSS [_custom properties_][25] for several years now. Heavy reliance on Javascript frameworks has obfuscated my knowledge of these changes, and my understanding of web development became filtered through framework-specific concepts.\n\n[Astro][26], then, is a breath of fresh air. Being focussed on static HTML generation first, it is most similar to [Jekyll][27] and [Hugo][28] (which I touched briefly to build a [small site][29]). Astro is friendlier than either of these for developers who are already used to Javascript and JSX, since it doesn’t require picking up another language (Ruby and Go, respectively).\n\nIn my experience so far, Astro provides the best of all worlds:\n- content management and Markdown support, like Jekyll and Gatsby\n- single file components with [scoped CSS][30], similar to [Svelte][31]\n- if you need some interactive UI, you can plug in a framework component as an “[_island_][32]” - this can be created with React, Svelte, Vue, whatever. E.g., this site is largely Javascript-free, but I imported the interactive [search][33] functionality from my previous Svelte incarnation.\n\nMost importantly, Astro forces me to think mainly in HTML and CSS, and consequently, to keep visual design decisions in the front of my mind, not buried underneath layers of Javascript libraries and optimizations.\n\nIt’s ironic that I started with an HTML-first static site generator and came all the way back around. The anti-JS sentiment that I’ve been seeing online might be a sign that the web community at large is taking a similar cyclical journey. Everything old is new again, it seems.\n\n[^1]:\tFor a fun summary of these terms and more, see [this video][8].\n\n[^2]:\tCliffNotes or SparkNotes for non-Canadian readers\n\n[^3]:\tJust a list off the top of my head:\n\t- [Redux Saga][16]\n\t- [Code-splitting][17]\n\t- [useMemo][18]\n\t- [react-query][19]\n\t- [immer][20]\n\n[^4]:\t🥁😏\n\n[1]:\thttps://jekyllrb.com/\n[2]:\thttps://www.gatsbyjs.com/\n[3]:\t/blog/2022/02/jekyll-gatsby\n[4]:\thttps://svelte.dev/\n[5]:\thttps://kit.svelte.dev/\n[6]:\thttps://tailwindcss.com/\n[7]:\thttps://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores\n[8]:\thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkx5ydvtpCA\n[9]:\thttps://astro.build/\n[10]:\t/blog/2022/02/jekyll-gatsby#user-content-fn-1\n[11]:\thttps://www.spicyweb.dev/why-tailwind-isnt-for-me/#reason-1-tailwind-promotes-ugly-ass-html\n[12]:\thttps://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/why-i-dont-like-tailwind-css/#1-tailwind-makes-your-code-difficult-to-read\n[13]:\thttps://javascript.plainenglish.io/tailwind-is-an-anti-pattern-ed3f64f565f0\n[14]:\thttps://infrequently.org/2023/02/the-market-for-lemons/\n[15]:\thttps://www.spicyweb.dev/the-great-gaslighting-of-the-js-age/\n[16]:\thttps://redux-saga.js.org/\n[17]:\thttps://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/\n[18]:\thttps://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo\n[19]:\thttps://tanstack.com/query/latest\n[20]:\thttps://immerjs.github.io/immer/\n[21]:\thttps://sass-lang.com/\n[22]:\thttps://emotion.sh/docs/introduction\n[23]:\thttps://styled-components.com/\n[24]:\thttps://stitches.dev/\n[25]:\thttps://caniuse.com/css-variables\n[26]:\thttps://astro.build\n[27]:\thttps://jekyllrb.com/\n[28]:\thttps://gohugo.io/\n[29]:\thttps://jacob-rob.com\n[30]:\thttps://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#scoped-styles\n[31]:\thttps://svelte.dev/docs#component-format-style\n[32]:\thttps://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/\n[33]:\t/blog/search",

Most books are either first-person (“_I_ went to the cobbler’s”) or third-person (“_She_ went to the haberdasher’s”). Therefore, it raises my eyebrows to see the much more uncommon _you_ usage. These three books use this technique for different reasons, and to varying degrees of success, in my opinion.\n\n# [_Interior Chinatown_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9ff7b20b-07f7-4d3d-a4f7-7ca29900e7d3)\n### by Charles Yu\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4e673499-cd60-485c-8f64-951bff43ccf0)\n\nI really wanted to like this book. The protagonist is Willis, the son of immigrants living in a U.S. Chinatown, a setting which is conducive to exactly the kind of cultural-identity soul-searching that I find myself doing more and more often these days. There are passages in this book that hit me right in the heart, e.g.\n\n> [Your father] says something you don't quite follow. You hear it, you catch most of the individual words, and yet somehow—you don't understand. This gap, always there. Somehow unbridgeable, whether it's across a wide Pacific gulf of language and culture, or just a simple sentence, father to son, always distance. The texture of everyday actions, simple movements and gestures, is harder than it looks. The great shame of your life that you can't speak his language, not really, not fluently.\n\nAs you can see, the prose is written in the second person. Why? That’s where the book fails for me. What you can’t see in the above quote is that the entire length of the book is typeset in a monospaced font that looks like a screenplay. There are also (some) dialogue sections that are formatted like that, with a character name centred and capitalized above the spoken lines. The conceit is supposed to be, Asian Americans have been portrayed in TV and movies as stock characters, like Old Asian Man, or Kung Fu Guy… but look, we don’t all follow the same script, see?\n\nUnfortunately, I think that the formal flourishes obscure the story and the message. Screenplays are not typically written in the second person anyway, so it feels like the book is clashing with itself stylistically.\n\nMore importantly, I spent the first half of the book wondering what exactly Willis even _is_: is he a character in a TV show, or is he an actor working on a TV show? Peripheral characters die and return, which would indicate a detachment from reality, i.e. they exist within the artifice of a show. However, sometimes the book inserts glimpses of behind-the-scenes filmmaking stuff, like a director giving notes, or the need to audition for parts, making it seem like it is taking place in a real-world production of a show.\n\nBy the second half of the book, I guess I could accept that we’re watching characters in a show, who _know_ that they’re in a show. But I consider it a miscalculation of the book that it failed to establish this clearly.\n\n# [_In the Dream House_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2048effe-bd2c-4766-9abe-23e80576667b)\n### by Carmen Maria Machado\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/b40785d2-b799-43e5-9549-f999fe3fa986)\n\nThis memoir covers Machado’s relationship with an abusive girlfriend. The second-person _you_ technique in this case works much better than the above. She splits her recollections into two perspectives: the pronoun _I_ signifies recovery, and moving on after the end of the abusive relationship, while the pronoun _you_ stands for the lived memories of the abuse.\n\nIt’s the perfect way to show the dissociation that can happen with trauma. The victim feels like the horrible experiences happened to someone else, and by casting _you_ in that role, it makes the reader intimately experience some pretty harrowing stuff.[^1]\n\n> You were not always just a You. I was whole—a symbiotic relationship between my best and worst parts—and then, in one sense of the definition, I was cleaved: a neat lop that took first person—that assured, confident woman, the girl detective, the adventurer—away from second, who was always anxious and vibrating like a too-small breed of dog.\n> \n> …\n> \n> I thought you died, but writing this, I'm not sure you did.\n\nThematically, the book opened my eyes to the realities of abuse in LGBTQ relationships. Machado writes that there’s reluctance in the queer community to discuss this topic because they fear that exposing the flaws of queer people will undermine their continuing fight for equality. But of course, silencing victims of abuse is just as bad as discrimination.\n\n# [_The Only Good Indians_](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/79437676-42a1-4936-86ac-b885a7f33ac9)\n### by Stephen Graham Jones\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/4bf0f8fc-3210-44fb-a227-235062ed07aa)\n\nThis is a horror novel, so I don’t think I’m spoiling too much to say that there’s a monster haunting the main characters. The cool thing is that the monster gets the _you_ pronoun. I didn’t pull any quotes, so let me try to demonstrate by paraphrasing[^2]. I’m very sorry, Mr. Jones.\n\n> Jimmy walks to the haberdasher’s, down the street lined with naked trees. Wet snow covers the ground, and he can feel the cold coming in through the hole in his shoe. Earlier this morning, when he was making a sandwich, he heard a rattling noise coming from the basement. He shrugged it off as the complaining of old pipes, but here, now, he can hear it again, behind him. Here, where there are no pipes, and no sandwiches for breakfast, only the pavement and the sound of wind through the dead branches of the trees. But still, the rattling noise. He spins around, but he doesn’t see you. You’re hiding behind the rusty husk of an abandoned car. Jimmy starts moving again. You’ll catch up to him soon…\n\nBecause the _you_ perspective is used sparingly, often popping up after pages and pages of third-person action, it’s jarring every time, and appropriately so. The monster is unnatural and isn’t supposed to be there. By putting the reader into the monster’s viewpoint, it causes this uncomfortable feeling of being _inserted_ into the story instead of just watching it.\n\nAnother thing I appreciated about this book was how the nature of the monster ties into Indigenous culture. Without spoiling too much, the monster is haunting the main characters because of something that they did in the past. At first, this misdeed, to me, seemed like no big deal. But it’s much more meaningful in the Blackfoot culture that the characters are from, and the book effectively brings the reader into that space.\n\n[^1]:\tI’m kind of jealous. I’ve worked with a survivor of sexual assault to write their story, and I came up with another way of capturing the dissociative experience, which in hindsight is so much more clunky than what Machado achieves here.\n\n[^2]:\tLet this in no way be taken as a comment on the quality of the writing. I’m being lackadaisical here just to show what I mean. I’m not trying to mock Jones’s style or anything; he’s a much better writer than I am.",

		"content": "TIFF this year was special because it was my first time attending in person since COVID. The digital screenings that they did the past two years were nice but it’s not really TIFF unless you’re juggling schedules and scrambling to get between screenings. I present these short reviews in no particular order:\n\n# [_Luxembourg, Luxembourg_][1]\n\nThe film tells the story of a pair of young men, twin brothers, who receive word that their estranged father is dying in Luxembourg. One of the brothers wishes to make the trip from their hometown in Ukraine, but the other brother has exorcised all love for their father and wants nothing to do with him.\n\nThis seems to set up the main conflict, but the film spends its first half without showing the brothers together much. Each of them go about their own lives and have their own misadventures (for one, workplace negligence and incompetence, causing injury; for the other, shitty in-laws), but neither of their storylines gets resolved when the second half rolls around and they suddenly decide to make the trip to Luxembourg after all.\n\nThroughout the film, I found myself confused by the smattering of chuckles from the audience at odd times. For example, there’s a scene where one of the brothers, having purchased a non-buoyant rubber ducky bath toy, brings it back to the toy store in a drunken rage, and waves a gun at the clerk. I believe the filmmakers were going for a kind of dark humour, but I was disturbed by the potential of violence.\n\nThere were some cool filmmaking techniques—flashy edits, camera moves and zooms, etc.—but between the disjointed story and the uncomfortable tone, I can’t say it enjoyed it very much.\n\n# [_The Grab_][2]\n\nSo there’s not enough farmland to produce food and water for the world’s growing population? \n\nAnd rich countries are buying up land outside their own borders, like in Africa?\n\nAnd they are pumping out water to ship back to their own countries, so much that the locals don’t have enough to grow their own crops?\n\nAnd they are hiring private armed mercenaries to do so, as if they expect there to be a fight?\n\nOh. Oh, well.\n\n(I’m sorry to be so flippant about it, but I’ve watched a [few][3] of this [type][4] of [documentary][5] in recent years, and it’s hard to respond in any other way. My feeling of helplessness about the state of global politics is best described by Jia Tolentino in her book [_Trick Mirror_][6]:\n\n> [T]o get through it with any psychological stability—to get through it without routinely descending into an emotional abyss—a person's best strategy is to think mostly of himself, herself.... I have felt so many times that the choice of this era is to be destroyed or to morally compromise ourselves in order to be functional—to be wrecked, or to be functional for reasons that contribute to the wreck.\n\n)\n\n# [_The Colour of Ink_][7]\n\nA good antidote to the previous documentary. There are no high stakes here, just an [artist][8] who helps other artists by making bespoke ink from materials that he finds in his surroundings. \n(Did you know that you can make ink out of: berries, rusty nails, blood, magnetic rocks, guns, flakes of paint that you pull off of a building, bugs, marble? _Did you know that??_) Each chapter of the film shows him creating a custom batch of ink for a painter or cartoonist or calligrapher, and every time, I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how the artist would end up using it. Every time, I was amazed.\n\n# [_Bones of Crows_][9]\n\nEven though some of the performances were weak, even though the lighting and set design sometimes looked cheap, even though the dialogue was often not subtle, the trauma and tragedy of the residential school system is so compelling that I was brought to tears in several scenes.\n\nApparently, there will be a [mini-series version][10] of this film out on CBC next year, which may be why the budget was stretched. I am interested to see how an extended runtime affects the storytelling. In its feature-length form, the film’s non-linear editing worked well for me, because it felt like all of the moments in the protagonist’s life were happening simultaneously.\n\n# [_Raymond & Ray_][11]\n\nWhen my grandmother passed away earlier this year, my father gave a eulogy which moved me, and further, made me ponder how I might speak about him when that inevitable day comes. I don’t have the musical skill to blow a plaintive jazz trumpet solo, like Ethan Hawke’s character does in this film; nor do I have access to a revolver with which to fire six roaring rounds into the casket, like Ewan McGregor’s character does. Neither of them speaks a single word; their eulogies are delivered with the raw bodily manifestations of their troubled emotions about their father.\n\nI had imagined myself, in the future, stumbling through words meant to honour and soothe. I would have no words. But after watching this film, I realized that when the time comes, and I’m standing there at the pulpit, those words will already have been written. I will have been writing them all my life.\n\n[1]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt19783714/\n[2]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt21820452/\n[3]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt9351980/\n[4]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt14671620/\n[5]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt16378064/\n[6]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8de58506-24c9-4803-8ce9-813c9c35ed62\n[7]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt10380976/\n[8]:\thttp://www.jasonslogan.com/\n[9]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt21342838/\n[10]:\thttps://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/bones-of-crows\n[11]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt15334032/",

If you open and flip through _Interior Chinatown_ by Charles Yu, you’ll see that the entire book is set in a Courier-like typewriter font. This choice supposedly makes the text appear like a screenplay, because the story is about a character, Willis Wu, who is… uh… a character in a TV show? Let me come back to that.\n\nAs you continue to flip through the pages of the book, you will next see that there are indeed sections of dialogue which are formatted like a screenplay, where the character name (in uppercase), and the lines that they speak (in lowercase), are centred on the page.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSPECIAL GUEST STAR\n\t\n\tRight.

		"content": "The Hot Docs film festival is becoming an annual staple at our house since they started doing streaming. I didn’t get around to writing my impressions of the films last year, but I will try this time around.\n\n# [_Blue Island_][1]\n\nThis film about the civil unrest in Hong Kong uses a unique re-enactment technique, which casts participants from the recent protests as older people who lived through various upheavals in HK’s past.\n\nLet me give an example, using some pseudonyms because I can’t remember the actual names. In one segment, we see a young man (Josh) being interrogated by law enforcement. This is actually a re-enactment of the experiences of an older man (Raymond) who was arrested in the 60’s. Josh-as-Raymond ends up sitting in a jail cell, but then we cut immediately to Josh-as-himself, sitting in the same jail cell and still in costume, talking about _his_ arrest and imprisonment in 2019/2020.\n\nLater, we also see the older Raymond(-as-himself), sitting in the same jail cell set, together with Josh(-as-himself). They have a conversation about the shared trauma of being arrested and beaten and jailed, and Raymond questions Josh about whether it’s really worth it. Does he really believe in the cause? Will the cause still matter to him in ten years, after he gets out of prison and the world has moved on?\n\nIt’s a powerful scene, made even more powerful by the fact that Raymond, in the 60’s, was imprisoned for speaking out against the British government, in support of the Chinese Communist Party. Josh, on the other hand, got in trouble for essentially the opposite: protesting against the CCP, in favour of democracy.\n\nThis scene in particular really drove home for me the complexities and contradictions of how HK even exists. It’s been easy to take sides for or against the recent protests, but this film provides the historical context which shows that Hong Kong has always had a fragmented identity. It makes it feel inevitable that the city would eventually fall apart. Someone says in the film that Hong Kongers themselves have never been able to control what happens to them and their city, and it’s a heart-breaking sentiment.\n\n# [_OKAY! The ASD Band Film_][2]\n\nThis was a nice dose of positivity. A lot of documentaries are about difficult social problems, so I wanted to choose at least one film which landed more on the “feel-good” side of things.\n\nWe follow a pop/rock band made up of four individuals on the autism spectrum as they write and record songs for an album ([_Fireflies_][3], well worth a listen), and we get some background on their family lives and upbringings. It’s meant to be inspirational and it works. I found myself wanting to see more of the friendship that develops between the four band members, but I suppose part of the point is that their bond is based primarily on the music that they make together, and not on more neurotypical ideas of interpersonal interactions.\n\nI don’t usually pick on film titles, but surely they could have come up with something more meaningful than _OKAY!_ It doesn’t represent or signify anything that happens in the film (say, for example, a catchphrase that the band members use with each other). Why not pick a song title or lyric from the band’s album?\n\nAlso, it seems to have led to some indecision about capitalization and punctuation in publications on the Internet. I’m seeing:\n\n- _Okay! (The ASD Band Film)_\n- _OKAY! The ASD Band Film_\n- and even _OKAY!: The ASD Band Film_\n\nWhich exclamation-point-plus-colon combo I kind of like, actually.\n\n\n# [_To the End_][4]\n\nI worry a lot about climate change, but I struggle with translating the anxiety into action. I simply don’t know what to do. I’m sure this is true of a lot of people. Watching this documentary about four women at the forefront of climate activism (one of which is the famed politician, AOC) amplified this helpless feeling for me. If these four people who are more passionate, more powerful and let’s face it, more youthful than I am can try so hard and still only manage to barely to move the needle, then what can _I_ really do with my limited reach and resources? But on the other hand, seeing that they are out there and fighting as hard as they can does open up another, more hopeful perspective: that the needle does move, even a little, and it’s happening close to the top of the power pyramid.\n\nAs far as storytelling goes, the film could have used a bit more contextual information. There are mentions of political slogans and taglines (“Build Back Better”, “Green New Deal”) that I was only peripherally familiar with, and congressional votes and elections that I had trouble fitting into an overall timeline. The results of said votes and elections would have had a more dramatic impact if the stakes were clearer.\n\n# [_The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales_][5]\n\nThis film follows a handful of Disneyland employees who are struggling to get by because of low wages and increasing living costs. Although it focusses on Disney as an employer, the inequality problem is a universal one across the U.S. I don’t think there was anything revelatory here for me, but that’s no fault of the film itself. I just happen to fall on the socialist side of the economic spectrum, and I believe that it does the world no good for wealth to flow unceasingly in one direction. As such, I tend to steep myself in anti-capitalist commentary online. There are some cool animated segments in the film which describe the history of capitalism, but again, it was nothing that I didn’t already know.\n\nAn interesting layer to this story is that one of the directors of the film is Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of one of Disney’s founders. I have a lot of respect for her speaking out against her own family’s legacy, even though she’s kind of saying, “Inequality is a problem, and the company that my family created is a big part of that problem… _BUT_, if my family was still in charge, instead of the corporate fat cats that took over, we would never have let this happen.”\n\nThis may be true, but it adds a bit of a narcissistic flavour to the documentary. Abigail herself appears in scenes where she interviews the Disney employees or various economic experts, and to me, it was unnecessary to insert herself in this way. Unfortunately, I think it weakens the message by making the viewer wonder about her motivations.\n\n---- \n\nAs a final note to self, my choices this year were on topics that I was already interested in, and I think it was detrimental to my overall enjoyment of the festival. More care needs to be taken next time to explore a more diverse slate of subjects.\n\n[1]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt15282802/\n[2]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt19498174/\n[3]:\thttps://tidal.com/browse/album/200492556\n[4]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt16378064/\n[5]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt17030826/",

		"description": "Saucy code",
		"content": "Recently, I’ve been working on some social and gamification features in a web application. I decided to use a backend service called [brainCloud][1] instead of implementing all of the database stuff myself. The brainCloud service stores things like player statistics, leaderboards and social relationships (i.e. who’s friends with who?), and provides an HTTP API to read and write the data. They also provide a [Javascript client library][2] to make it easier to work with those APIs.\n\nWithout getting into too many specifics, the library follows a callback style for handling asynchronous behaviour. When you call one of their functions, it sends an HTTP request; when the server responds, it executes the code in the callback function that you pass as a parameter. For example,\n\n```javascript\npostScoreToLeaderboard(leaderboardId, score, (resp) => {\n\tif (resp.successful) {\n\t\t// do something with the data\n\t\tconsole.log('We got data!', resp.data);\n\t} else {\n\t\tconsole.log('We got an error!', resp.error);\n\t}\n});\n```\n\nPersonally, I prefer to handle asynchronous code using promises in the `await`/`async` style.\n\nA general pattern to follow to convert a callback interface to a promise-based one is to build a `Promise` object and return it.\n\n_(N.B.: For the purposes of this post, I’ll follow the convention of prefixing a function name with an underscore to indicate that it’s a “wrapper” around a brainCloud API function.)_\n\n```javascript\nconst _postScoreToLeaderboard = (leaderboardId, score) => {\n\treturn new Promise(resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tpostScoreToLeaderboard(leaderboardId, score, (resp) => {\n\t\t\tif (resp.successful) {\n\t\t\t\tresolve(resp.data);\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treject(resp.error);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t});\n};\n```\n\nNow, we can use this function without a callback:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n\tconst data = await _postScoreToLeaderboard(leaderboardId, score);\n\t// do something with the data\n\tconsole.log('We got data!', data);\n} catch (e) {\n\tconsole.log('We got an error!', e);\n}\n```\n\nThis works, but there are many functions in the brainCloud API. How can we extend this technique in a generic way?\n\nTo illustrate, here’s a couple of other brainCloud methods for gamification:\n\n```javascript\ngetLeaderboardTop(leaderboardId, (resp) => {\n\t// handle response\n});\n\nincrementUserStats(statId, value, (resp) => {\n\t// handle response\n});\n```\n\nIt would be a lot of repetitive code to wrap each of these in a function:\n\n```javascript\n// TOO MUCH CODE!\n\nconst _getLeaderboardTop = (leaderboardId) => {\n\treturn new Promise(resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tgetLeaderboardTop(leaderboardId, (resp) => {\n\t\t\t// handle response\n\t\t})\n\t});\n};\n\nconst _incrementUserStats = (statId, value) => {\n\treturn new Promise(resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tincrementUserStats(statId, value, (resp) => {\n\t\t\t// handle response\n\t\t})\n\t});\n};\n```\n\nTo reduce duplication, we can _curry_ the functions.\n\n### A brief introduction to currying\n\nIf you’re not familiar with the term, [_currying_][3] a function creates a new function with parameters that can be called one by one.\n\nThe classic example is a function that adds three numbers together.\n\n```javascript\nconst add = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;\n\n// create a curried function\nconst curriedAdd = curry(add);\n\nconst addOne = curriedAdd(1);\n\n// this is equivalent to calling add(1, 2, 3)\nconst x = addOne(2, 3);\n\n// x is 6\n```\n\nNote that this only returns the final result of 6 if we “use up” all three parameters of the original function. If, instead, you leave the final parameter “unused,” it will return yet another function.\n\n```javascript\n// we have \"used up\" two out of three parameters\nconst addSeven = addOne(6);\n\n// this is equivalent to calling add(1, 6, 10)\nconst y = addSeven(10);\n\n// y is 17\n```\n\n### Back to our regularly scheduled programming\n\nWith this approach, we can curry the functions from the brainCloud API. For example,\n\n```javascript\nconst _incrementUserStats = curry(incrementUserStats);\n```\n\nThis particular function has two input parameters, and a third for a callback. If we call the curried version with the two input parameters, it will return a function that accepts a callback and executes the original function once it receives the callback.\n\n```javascript\nconst fn = _incrementUserStats('statId', 15);\n\nconst handleResponse = (resp) => {\n\t// do something\n};\n\n// this is equivalent to calling \n// incrementUserStats('statId', 15, handleResponse)\nfn(handleResponse);\n```\n\nI named the final function `fn` because this part can be generalized to any API call that takes a callback as its final parameter.\n\nIf we create a function that takes a function like `fn` and calls it, we can then use a Promise-based pattern for making these API calls.\n\n```javascript\nconst makeAPICall = (fn) => {\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tfn((resp) => {\n\t\t\tif (resp.successful) {\n\t\t\t\tresolve(resp.data);\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treject(resp.error);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t});\n};\n```\n\nTo use this, we call one of the curried functions with all of its parameters _except for the final callback parameter_, and pass the result to the `makeAPICall` function.\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n\tconst data = await makeAPICall(_incrementUserStats('statId', 15));\n\t// do something with the result\n\tconsole.log('We got data!', data);\n} catch (e) {\n\tconsole.log('We got an error!', e)\n}\n```\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```javascript\n// curry all of the functions that we want to use\nconst _postScoreToLeaderboard = curry(postScoreToLeaderboard);\nconst _getLeaderboardTop = curry(getLeaderboardTop);\nconst _incrementUserStats = curry(incrementUserStats);\n\n// define the function that receives a callback \n// and executes the original function\nconst makeAPICall = (fn) => {\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\t\tfn((resp) => {\n\t\t\tif (resp.successful) {\n\t\t\t\tresolve(resp);\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treject(resp);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t});\n\t});\n};\n\n// now we can make API calls like this\nconst result1 = await makeAPICall(_postScoreToLeaderboard('id', 100));\nconst result2 = await makeAPICall(_getLeaderboardTop('id'));\nconst result3 = await makeAPICall(_incrementUserStats('statId', 15));\n```\n\nAs a final note, the `curry` function itself is available in the popular [lodash][4] library of Javascript utilities.\n\n[1]:\thttps://getbraincloud.com/\n[2]:\thttps://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-js\n[3]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying\n[4]:\thttps://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#curry",

		"description": "Compare and contrast",
		"content": "After [my experience][1] with _Beijing Confidential_, I felt compelled to expose myself to writing about China by native and contemporary authors. [_China in Ten Words_][2] wasn't exactly what I was looking for--I wanted more focus on modern China, i.e. what is it like _now_--but it was still an enlightening read.\n\nEach of the ten essays in this collection is a meditation on a Chinese phrase, which are all shown on the cover, in case you're too lazy to open to the table of contents.\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/c51554a3-18da-4bde-8415-b9789d748100)\n\nI was a bit impatient through the first half of the book, which deals with the author's childhood during the Cultural Revolution in the 1960’s. It covers ground that doesn't feel new to me because of my time with [other][3] [books][4]. I wanted him to get to the present day, which he does indeed do towards the second half. I would say that the earlier parts of the book do lay an important foundation for the rest of it, because as a whole, the book can be seen as a compare-and-contrast exercise between the time of Mao's rule and today.\n\nIn one memorable passage, Yu describes an incident during his childhood, when he and some other kids enacted vigilante justice against a man who was illegally trading food stamps. The kids physically assaulted the man, but the man didn't retaliate; instead, he broke down and cried in remorse.\n\nIn contrast, Yu recounts a story from more recent times, where an unlicensed street vendor stabbed and killed a government official who was trying to enforce the rules by shutting down the shop.\n\nYu sees this as a breakdown in the morality of the country. He seems almost nostalgic for the black-and-white authoritarianism of Mao's day, as opposed to the everyone-for-themselves mentality of today. He acknowledges the brutality of the past, especially for the violent acts of his youth, but suggests that there was some value in unity, where everyone agrees what's right and wrong. The man that Yu and the other kids assaulted didn't retaliate because he knew he was breaking the rules.\n\n> So China moved from Mao Zedong's monochrome era of politics-in-command to Deng Xiaoping's polychrome era of economics above all. \"Better a socialist weed than a capitalist seedling,\" we used to say in the Cultural Revolution. Today we can't tell the difference between what is capitalist and what is socialist—weeds and seedlings come from one and the same plant.\n> - Yu Hua\n\nPersonally, I've seen this attitude from the older generations of my family, who seem to believe that obedience is paramount. I don't always agree, but I've been trying to recognize where they’re coming from. This book has further enlightened me to the differences between the two cultures that I inhabit.\n\n[1]:\t/blog/2022/01/beijing-confidential\n[2]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cb7766a0-1df8-4546-9f61-20296fbccc9b\n[3]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a800bcb0-746e-494d-8531-459391d0d954\n[4]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/547fb024-de78-43df-bcf3-2415eb3e6865",

		"description": "R. L. Stevenson v. F. S. Fitzgerald?",
		"content": "[Previously](/blog/2022/01/revive-again), I mentioned that I was building this website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), after having moved off the friendly-but-closed system of Squarespace. Since then, I pivoted again, and landed on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). My motivations for the switch were somewhat esoteric so I thought I'd explain myself here.\n\nI have nothing against Jekyll itself. I like the simplicity of its templating system and how you can see exactly what HTML it generates. I like that blog posts just go into a directory called `_posts` and get picked up without any extra configuration.\n\nMy first crack at building the site involved choosing one of the [many themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) that are available online. It's a good way to get started without worrying too much about the code. But I'm a tinkerer by nature and I couldn't help but try to customize things like colours and fonts.\n\nI had been playing around with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and I'm a big fan of working with CSS this way.[^1] I decided to edit my Jekyll templates and customize the style using Tailwind. In hindsight, it might have been less time-consuming to start from scratch without a theme, but even so, the code changes weren't hard to do. Anyway, before I got too far, I ran into the issues that ultimately put an end to my time with Jekyll.\n\nI'm hosting this site on the [DigitalOcean App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform)[^2], which is a _zero-configuration_ hosting solution. You just point to a GitHub repo, and it goes, _\"Hey, that looks like Jekyll!\"_ and automatically builds and hosts the site with a CDN. As nice as that is, it became a roadblock when it came to combining Jekyll with Tailwind.\n\nWhen the DO App Platform goes _\"Hey, that looks like Jekyll!\"_, what it does next is to start a [Buildpack](https://buildpacks.io/) to execute the build. Because Jekyll is implemented in Ruby, the Jekyll Buildpack contains a Ruby executable.\n\nThe problem is, Tailwind is implemented in Javascript. It integrates into a Jekyll build by having the Ruby process spawn a NodeJS process. This works fine in an environment which has both Ruby and NodeJS installed, like my local development laptop. But the Buildpack only contains the Ruby executable, so it chokes when it gets to the NodeJS part.\n\nI couldn't find any way to choose a different Buildpack or to provide my own Buildpack or anything like that. I don't blame DigitalOcean for not supporting advanced custom builds--it is supposed to be zero-configuration, after all.\n\nI could have moved off the App Platform and created my own build system, but I have a soft spot for what DigitalOcean is trying to do, so I decided to try a different tack. I don't need much of an excuse to play around with different tools anyway, so I turned my attention to Gatsby.\n\nSince Gatsby is implemented in Javascript, I didn't foresee that it would have any issues with Tailwind. DigitalOcean would just say, _\"Hey, that looks like Gatsby!\"_, and start a Buildpack that has a NodeJS executable, which is what Tailwind needs as well.\n\nLo and behold, this is the tech stack that I've landed on... Gatsby with Tailwind, hosted on DigitalOcean App Platform.\n\nI might write more about Gatsby specifically in the future, but that's all for now.\n\n[^1]: It's like [CSS without CSS](https://youtu.be/Pex_0zg9EsE?t=112). \n[^2]: I see DO as the underdog David to the Goliaths of AWS and GCP and Azure.",

		"description": "A Tale of Self-Discovery",
		"content": "As a foreign exchange student at Beijing University during the Cultural Revolution, Jan Wong ratted out a classmate who expressed a treasonous desire to leave the country for the West. The classmate disappeared and Wong, driven by guilt, embarked on a mission to find her and make amends.\n\nThe search for the classmate gives _[Beijing Confidential: A Tale of Comrades Lost and Found][1]_ its main narrative drive, but the book also reads like a family vacation travelogue, since she has brought her husband and two sons along for the trip. As a result, the detective story to find the missing classmate feels overblown. It turns out that the classmate would have been in lot of trouble anyway, whether or not Wong had reported her. In essence, Wong's role in the whole affair was minimal, and her guilt about it, while valid, isn't expressed with enough emotional weight to sustain a whole book. It makes her seem self-centred by making it all about herself.\n\nHaving said that, let's now make it all about me. _Beijing Confidential_ is written with a certain tone that feels uncomfortably familiar to me: that of an Asian person, raised in the West, looking back on the \"homeland\" with foreign eyes, and seeing mostly absurdity and otherness. I've [written in this mode before][2]. Essentially, this type of writing evokes a feeling of, _Wow, isn't it strange over there?_\n\n_Isn't it strange that how bad the traffic and air pollution is?_\n\n_Isn't it strange that they eat those smelly durians?_\n\n_Isn't it strange that a Communist country has embraced capitalism so readily?_\n\nIf I had read this book five years ago, this tone would have struck a genuine chord with me: my personal travel experiences to China and Asia had been anxious affairs. Reading it now, I'm turned off by it because I've been questioning my biases. The anxiety was _my_ fault, not China’s.\n\n> Based on unscientific observations, I've noticed that a culture's personal space is inversely proportional to its population density. Take Finland, which has only one-third as many people as the entire city of Beijing. On a recent trip there with Sam's hockey team, I saw a Finnish man waiting impatiently—two meters behind a Canadian dad—at a salad bar in Lohja, population 41,400. The Canadian took his sweet time filling his plate, unaware someone was waiting for access to the pickled herring. In Canada, the salad-bar norm is about two bowls' distance. In China, the person behind you would be digging into the same bowl, then leapfrogging you in the line.\n> - Jan Wong\n\nMy family is from Hong Kong, and growing up, I absorbed by osmosis an anti-China sentiment. Bathed in Hong Kong's modernity, we saw Mainlanders as backwards and uncivilized and rude. The speed of China's eventual growth was seen as unearned, like they had gotten there by cheating.\n\nWhen Hong Kong was struck by [civil unrest][3] a couple of years ago, it was a natural reaction for me to take the side of the protestors, against China. But, to my surprise, some members of my family went the other way, leading to some heated debates. It shocked and confused me because it was such a 180 from what I grew up with.\n\nNow that time has passed, I'm ready to see their side of it. Yes, Mainland China was on the other side of a border from us, but that border was dictated by external colonial forces. Even though I grew up believing that the Western influence was beneficial to us, it doesn’t mean that I should forget the shared ethnic and cultural history that existed before Communism and British colonialism. I’m not saying that I love China, but I’ve been trying to not take for granted some of the assumptions and prejudices that I hold against them.\n\nSo, when I read a book like _Beijing Confidential_, it feels like it represents a state of mind that I used to have, and that I’m trying to expand myself beyond. It makes me want to read a book that will put me in the shoes of someone who is not like me, someone who sees China as their home, and not a strange, foreign place.\n\n[1]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b956c14d-b0d7-464f-9d26-2fad12e37dce\n[2]:\t/blog/2022/01/bracelet-blackmail\n[3]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests",

		"content": "_I wrote this piece circa 2012, after I took a trip to several countries in Asia. I was never able to get it published, so I figured I might as well post it here. I was reminded of it while reading a book by Jan Wong called_ [Beijing Confidential: A Tale of Comrades Lost and Found in the New Forbidden City][1]. _This piece feels to me like a less polished, smaller version of Wong's book, down to the slightly huffy subtitle._\n\n_I'm a bit conflicted about the tone of both this essay and_ Beijing Confidential, _about which more [later][2]._\n\n---\n\n“If you don’t take this bracelet, then you don’t like Cambodia.”\n\nThe little Cambodian girl is six years old, or maybe seven, or maybe five. She must be around four feet tall, but her skinny frame, and my own delirium from the sun, makes me think that she doesn’t even come up to my knee. Her dark hair is dry (also from the sun?) and uncombed.\n\nWhat she’s doing is she’s trying to give me a bracelet. It’s a cheap brown thing, made of bamboo or reed or some other plant material. She and I stand just outside an Angkor temple. I can see the tall stone structure, and even though I’ve already visited a few of them, it’s still an impressive sight.\n\nLocal businesspeople have set up booths along the wooded path to the holy place, so that it’s impossible to approach without pushing through a pack of vendors. They sell: drinks, postcards, T-shirts, books, bracelets, _&c_. I say “pushing,” not in the literal physical sense, but in the psychological sense where I put my head down, and my gait becomes resolute, and I enter a shell of pure focus, and just keep moving forward, forward, forward. Some of the more aggressive vendors actually jump in front of me, and I have to bob and weave to evade them.\n\nI don’t want the bracelet that the little girl is giving me. She claims that it’s a free gift, but of course, the idea is that it will plant the seed of guilt in my mind, which will make me come back and buy something later. It is basically blackmail. I try to wave her off with my right hand. My left hand is resting on the camera bag which I have hanging by my hip. She spots this opening, and plunks the bracelet down on my left forearm. It itches because my skin is sunburnt.\n\nI keep pushing forward, annoyed, and I accelerate, as if I’m trying to get away from a swarm of gnats. I don’t quite break into a run because it’s too hot for that. Also, people are watching, and it’s embarrassing to run away from small harmless things like gnats or little girls.\n\nMy forward momentum makes the bracelet fall off my arm, and it lands in the loamy, red Cambodian dirt. The little girl picks it up again, and somehow her short little legs can keep up with my long strides, and that’s when she says:\n\n“If you don’t take this bracelet, then you don’t like Cambodia.”\n\nI’m writing this several weeks after returning from my trip, and I still can’t say or even think the word “Cambodia” without hearing it in the little girl’s voice, and then hearing my mind’s ear fill in the rest of the sentence in her nasally, sing-song accent. It is haunting me.\n\n_If you don’t take this bracelet, then you don’t like Cambodia._\n\nAs I continue towards the Angkor ruins, I have a grin on my face, the kind of false grin that I tend to put on as a friendly veneer whenever I need to mask my confusion or social anxiety.\n\nIt’s my third week away from my home in Toronto. Cambodia is the fourth and final Asian country on my itinerary. How did I get here, thinking of this girl as I would think of gnats, and as the subject of a false grin, instead of as a human child?\n\n---\n\nMy first stop is Beijing, where my friends and I have hired a local tour guide. She is a cheery young woman named Kathy, who often punctuates her sentences by looking you right in the eye and saying, “Right?”, as if she needs to confirm that you agree with her at all times, e.g. “That was a good restaurant… right?”; “It is very beautiful… right?”\n\nThere’s a standard set of tourist attractions that everybody sees in Beijing, and Kathy covers them well. The scale of the city is so large that each time we enter a temple or palace, it feels like going to a different city altogether. Everywhere we go is crowded. We often see tour leaders waving big fluorescent flags, trailed by a tour group wearing hats of the same fluorescent colour. I think they look silly, until I realize that I’ve been separated from my friends and Kathy, and I try to look for them in the faces all around and I start to panic and wish I had a fluorescent hat of my own. The smog makes it hard to breathe.\n\nIn front of the Forbidden City, we see a woman being apprehended by a plainclothes police officer for selling souvenir picture books. The officer grabs her by the arm and she starts wailing, pleading. Kathy explains the situation to us, that vendors are prohibited in certain government-prescribed areas. “It’s scary… right?”\n\nWhere merchants are allowed, they see that we have a local with us, so even the aggressive ones keep their distance. Kathy’s presence acts as a sort of shield, with one notable exception, which I will return to later.\n\nMore about Kathy first. It’s clear that she’s fond of explaining small facts and details. Some of this is for the purpose of planning our excursions: “We will take the subway for two stops, and transfer to Line 2 for three stops, and then walk for ten minutes. We will arrive at our destination in forty-three minutes.” But her habit of quoting numerical facts and figures also applies to subjects other than the purely procedural. I don’t know if it’s because we keep asking her about it, but she always circles back to one topic: money, and how much (or usually, how little) things cost here. Gas costs _x_ amount, which converts to such-and-such Canadian dollars. It costs so-and-so to see a movie. A bottle of mineral water costs this many _yuan_. And things are indeed cheap, and she is perhaps enjoying our incredulous reactions a bit too much, like low prices are, for her, a point of national pride.\n\nThe exception I mentioned earlier, the place where Kathy cannot shield us from Aggressive Vendors, is a place called the Hongqiao Pearl Market. She cannot shield us, not because she is incapable, but because the market seems to exist specifically to allow merchants to accost tourists. The tourists have a fun time haggling, and it’s all part of the genuine Chinese experience.\n\nKathy seems conflicted. She wants to help us bargain for low prices, and before we go in, she whispers to us that we can negotiate down to around 20% of the price tag on most items. This will be the absolute minimum though, because the vendors will be making very little profit, if any. After she tells us this, she shuts up; I think she feels like she’s betraying the spirit of the whole operation. But my friends and I hang on to this information like a secret weapon.\n\nThe market is a multi-level, vaguely industrial building. The shop booths are laid out, open concept, on all sides of a grid of narrow walkways. Nothing separates shopper from shopkeeper. They can reach out and grab you, and sometimes they do. They sell: shirts, cameras, pants, phone accessories, trinkets, paintings, laptop computers, _&c_. The place is called “Pearl Market” because there are a couple of levels devoted entirely to pearls. How the twenty-five to thirty pearl booths, all selling the exact same things, compete with each other and determine fair pricing is a microeconomic puzzle that remains, to me, unsolved.\n\nThe market is somehow both claustrophobic and agoraphobic at once. I feel a bit overwhelmed and overstimulated. I don’t enjoy crowds, especially if it involves being yelled at from all sides. I deal with this by not making eye contact with, or talking to, anyone; not even to say hello. Once I’m in my shell, the vendors have no chance. I buy nothing at the Pearl Market.\n\nI do, however, watch my friends haggle. They end up buying some small wooden and jade figurines. Negotiation proceeds via both parties punching numbers into a big plastic-buttoned calculator, and pointing, and hand-waving. When they settle on a price, close to the secret 20% mark, the shopkeeper accepts it with a sort of tragic sigh, the defeat evident in her face. \n\nEven though I’m not involved in any transactions, I start to feel a little guilty that we (my friends and I, or maybe all Western tourists) have come here and robbed these poor merchants of their profits, just to save what amounts to the price of a couple of Starbucks lattés on a piece of unique handcrafted art.\n\nBut then, something else hits me: this practice of measuring prices in terms of Starbucks lattés is a cliché, and one that comes from a position of privilege. Here are some things that we are constantly told we can do if we skip the daily coffee: send an unborn future child to university, pay off a mortgage sooner, sponsor a child in a Third World country. And yes, maybe even help a poor Chinese merchant make a profit.\n\nOnly smug, well-off people who can afford to go to Starbucks every day think in this way. I realize that I must be one of those people.\n\n---\n\nKaron Beach in Phuket, Thailand, is pretty much the exact opposite of Beijing, in terms of mood, air quality, population density, and general comfort level. The town consists of a beach and a main road with shops and restaurants, and not much else. I don’t know whether it’s the lack of smog or the lack of crowds that has me breathing more freely than I ever did in China.\n\nRight next to the beach, there’s a structure which houses a row of open-air restaurants. Think of your average strip plaza and imagine the front wall removed. Such an architecture allows diners to dine in the path of ocean breezes, which is a not unpleasant way to dine. Crucially, there’s a roof, which provides shelter from the sudden, brief, intense rainstorms that darken the skies from time to time.\n\nDuring one such storm, my friends and I are forced to take shelter beneath the roof of this structure. We’re hungry, but all of the restaurants look the same to us. They sell: pad thai noodles, tom yum soup, crab, fish, curries, _&c_. With little to distinguish between these restaurants (it’s the pearl booth microeconomic puzzle all over again), the only way we can make a decision is by how loud the restauranteurs are yelling for us to come in. We end up going to the one where the sales pitch is given by a wiry, tattooed guy with spiked hair and multiple facial piercings.\n\nThe food is good, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve been bullied into eating here.\n\n---\n\nOf our four destinations, Kuala Lumpur is the city that feels most familiar. The shopping experience here is one that I’m used to: impersonal, laid-back shopping in large malls. It is acceptable to just say, “Just browsing,” and leave it at that. And I mean, just saying, “Just browsing,” in English, and not going through the flurry of awkward hand motions that were common during our dialogues with Chinese and Thai locals.\n\nWe stay in a hotel within walking distance of the famous twin Petronas Towers. At the base of the Towers, there’s a large, glitzy mall called Suria KLCC. They sell: high-end fashion, jewellery, ethnically diverse food in food court, brand-name athletic wear, handbags, _&c_. KLCC becomes the default destination for our group when we don’t have any specific place to go. We’re drawn to it for its familiar Western feel, but it’s just foreign enough (e.g. clothing brands we don’t recognize, a bookstore where books are wrapped in clear plastic film, a snack stand for durian-based desserts) that we still feel like we’re touristing and therefore not wasting time at the mall again. It’s the prototypical East-meets-West experience. I think we go there every day, but I’m not sure.\n\nOne of the purposes of our trip is to attend a friend’s wedding. The bride’s family lives in Malaysia, and we meet and chat with some of them. When we mention KLCC, they immediately suggest that we go to Chinatown instead, because there are much better deals to be had there. I’m hesitant because going to a Chinatown seems redundant after having already been to China, but I’ll go, if only for the opportunity to see some more East/West clashing in action.\n\nThe centre of Chinatown is Petaling Street, which is less of a street than a narrow alley lined with shop booths on both sides. Pedestrians walk all over the road, but once in a while, a horn sounds, and everyone disperses to let a car or motorcycle through. Most of the vendors promote (by shouting) cheap brand-name clothing items which are surely knockoffs.\n\nAfter a while, I’m feeling a little dazed and starting to go into my shell again. I’m looking for escape routes, and that’s when I have my most direct encounter with an Aggressive Vendor. A short stocky man sneaks up beside me. He has in his hands the thin cardboard sleeve of what I recognize to be a pirated DVD. A second later, I notice that the artwork on the sleeve is of a pornographic nature. Like, nipples are visible.\n\n“Sex movie,” he says in a quiet, nervous voice.\n\n(Now is a good time to mention that I am Chinese-Canadian. I believe that this gives me a slight immunity as most of the A.V.s in China and in KL Chinatown don’t pester me as much as they pester my Caucasian friends; they don’t like to harass their own kind, I suppose. Or maybe they know that frugal Asians will be a hard sell, and not worth the effort. Or maybe it’s just me, because I’m so aloof and disinclined to make eye contact. Having said that, the sex movie guy seems to believe that even frugal, aloof Asians are always in the market for a sex movie.) \n\n“No thanks,” I tell the sex movie guy.\n\n---\n\n“If you don’t take this bracelet, then you don’t like Cambodia.”\n\nI don’t want to take the bracelet, but I _do_ like Cambodia. It’s this cognitive dissonance that breaks me out of my shell, and I actually interact with the girl instead of just waving her away. I take the bracelet from her outstretched little hand and slip it onto my wrist.\n\nShe smiles and says in a pleading but still sing-song way, “Sir, you come back later, sir?”\n\n“Yes, I come back later,” I say.\n\nThe girl leaves me alone to sightsee at the temple. I take my pictures and when I’m done, I dread going back towards the main road because I will run into her again. Her blackmail has worked, and now I feel like I owe her something. When she appears, I see that she has prepared a stack of postcards to show me.\n\n“One dollar, sir,” she says. “One dollar ten postcard. One, two, three…” \n\nShe flips each postcard from the top of the stack to reveal the next one underneath. It’s a deft manoeuvre, like something you would see with a casino blackjack dealer. By the time she gets to ten, each snap of a postcard is like a crack of thunder, which when combined with her high sing-songy voice, and the added emotional stress of her earlier blackmail, has me firmly back in my shell. I almost do run away from her this time.\n\nA more open and charitable person might fork over the one dollar just because the little girl is so cute. And charity is what it feels like: the postcards and bracelets have little worth, but maybe that little girl could have a decent meal with that dollar. When I get back to the hotel that day, I wonder if I could have been that more open, charitable person, if only my trip had started in Cambodia, and I hadn’t been fending off Aggressive Vendors for two weeks.\n\n---\n\nIt didn’t occur to me at the time, but since returning home, I’ve learned that maybe I did the right thing by not doing business with the girl. Many of the child vendors are making money not for themselves or their families, but for organized, sometimes criminal, groups. Allowing them to earn profits only encourages the practice, and keeps the kids out of school.\n\nArmed with this knowledge, I could sell you the idea that my decision not to buy from the little girl was made for the right reasons: to promote social change, to condemn the exploitation of children, to stand up for human rights, _&c_. But that would be untrue. The truth is that I didn’t buy from her, or from any vendors that I encountered during the trip, because of my own personal faults. I am unsociable and detached and aloof, and even cute little girls bearing gifts can’t break that shell.\n\nAs for the bracelet itself, I forgot to pack it when I checked out of the hotel. When I last saw it, it was sitting beside the bathroom sink, soaking in a puddle of soapy water, an abandoned souvenir.\n\n\n[1]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b956c14d-b0d7-464f-9d26-2fad12e37dce\n[2]:\t/blog/2022/01/beijing-confidential\n\n",

		"description": "Positive or negative?",
		"content": "When reading this short story collection, it helped me to be aware of the author's Indigenous background. (Her author bio page says that she lives in Gitxsan territory in British Columbia.) The stories themselves aren't necessarily explicit that their characters and themes come from that culture, and if I didn't know about the author's background, it might be easy to categorize them as \"magical realism,\" because of the supernatural beings that inhabit them (e.g. ghosts, a boy with fox ears, a lady with a big head). But that genre classification seems a bit disrespectful to me, since it comes from literary academic theory. The book is more of an expression of the author's culture.\n\nI didn't love every story in this collection, but the ones that I did, I loved a lot. I want to point out the two that I enjoyed most, both of which deal with anxieties around motherhood: the desire to become a mother, but on the flipside, an honest examination of the hardships of motherhood.\n\n---\n\n**\"Malarkey\"** is about a couple where the negligent male partner, Dev, is obsessed with a graphic novel that he's writing. His story triggered my penchant for sci-fi, and is presented in a cool way by Lalonde: in dry, [DFW][1]-esque footnotes that mock him without being mean about it. The intergalactic content of his story reminds me of [_Saga_][2], and the story-within-a-story idea reminds me of Margaret Atwood's [_The Blind Assassin_][3].\n\nOn the other side of this relationship, the female partner Marianne holds a deep resentment that Dev doesn't want to commit to parenthood with her, while at the same time accepting that she doesn't have many other options if she wants to fulfill her goal at becoming a mother.\n\n> For weeks she fumed and sputtered, biting at her nails, going around things in her head convinced of what she'd suspected all along--that his uncertainties and self-interest would rob her of a motherhood she had once waffled about wanting, but that was now the thing she desired most to make real.\n> - Angélique Lalonde\n\nThe story asks the question, is parenthood still desirable, even if only one partner is willing to participate? In my idealistic mind, I believe the answer should be _No_, because it feels unfair, that one partner should bear all of the responsibility. But \"Malarkey\" made me reconsider, and I'm still wrestling with the question.\n\n---\n\n**\"The Pregnancy Test\"** explores similar ground, through the perspective of several women who stumble upon a discarded pregnancy test in a public washroom.\n\nPregnancy tests are [often mined][4] for drama in rom-coms or TV sitcoms, and I like that this story compresses the many possible reactions into a quick series of vignettes, while also adding complexity beyond the _\"This is the happiest day of my life!\"_/_\"My life is ruined!\"_ dichotomy.\n\nOne of the women who sees the test hopes for it to be positive, because she herself hopes for a positive test. Another, a new mother, doesn't even remember how she reacted to her own test, because she's so burnt out by taking care of the baby. An older woman laughs to herself about how gross sex is, glad that she's moved beyond that phase in her life, but maybe also a little wistful.\n\nThe story notably leaves out the result of the actual pregnancy test, and doesn't give any information about the woman who took it, other than her name. \n\n> A real woman in the world walking around with relief or great happiness, perplexing ambiguity or abject terror, curiosity or bewilderment.\n> - Angélique Lalonde\n\nIn that way, it forces you as the reader to think about your own reaction. Do you want it to be positive or negative?\n\n[1]:\thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace\n[2]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/series/1235\n[3]:\thttps://app.thestorygraph.com/books/248c2269-e347-48a7-a99d-5de06635b5ed\n[4]:\thttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PregnancyTestPlot",

		"description": "Beware of Big Truffle",
		"content": "[_The Truffle Hunters_][1] is a documentary film about a bunch of old dudes in Italy who work with dogs to find truffles[^1] buried in the ground, deep inside forests. As a dog lover, I envy the working relationship that these people have with their dogs. My dog is great, but she's never going to help me write any Javascript.\n\nThe film is visually gorgeous, made up mostly of static shots that are perfectly composed, lit and colour-graded. One shot that springs to mind is of a married couple sitting behind a stack of tomatoes, washing them one by one. Every unblemished tomato is a deep, rich shade of red.\n\nWhile it looks great, the impeccable style makes me question the authenticity of some of the more emotional scenes. I couldn't help but imagine the filmmakers meticulously setting up the camera and the subjects, and waiting for the perfect sun, and then saying \"action\" to what is supposed to be a genuine outpouring of emotion. For example, there's one scene involving a distraught and crying truffle hunter, telling a police officer that one of his dogs has been poisoned by ruthless corporate truffle hunters trying to encroach on his territory. I felt bad for him, but still, I had to ask myself, _Is he acting here?_\n\nWhich brings us to the dark side of the film: because truffles are so rare and valuable, greed and competition have entered into the truffle hunters' lives. I've always had a distaste for \"foodie\" culture because of the accompanying snobbishness, and this film pushed those buttons for sure. _The Truffle Hunters_ depicts the middlemen and consumers of the truffles as shady characters. They haggle for low prices with the hunters in nighttime back-alley meetings, before turning around and selling to restaurants for a huge profit margin. They berate hunters for leaving a little bit of dirt on the goods. They demand attention from journalists and photographers by holding truffle exhibitions. And worst of all, they are seemingly involved in the intentional harm of innocent animals.\n\nThe cost of elevating food to a status symbol is that honest and hard-working people (and their beloved pets) are exploited and hurt.\n\n\n[^1]:\tPersonally, I don't get what the big deal is about truffles. Generally, I have a strong sense of smell--I once identified blue cheese as a condiment in a colleague's sandwich from all the way at the other end of the lunch cafeteria table--but when I've tried truffle-based dishes, the supposedly distinctive aroma just doesn't hit me.\n\n[1]:\thttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt11394318/",

		"content": "It's kind of embarassing, looking back at this [previous post][1]. It sounded like I was arriving somewhere, where in fact, those \"big changes in my life\" just kept rolling. I got married, got a dog, moved house, changed jobs (twice). Where I've landed is a place where I've seen my creative output trail off, enough to miss it, enough to want to return to it.\n\nI'll start off by describing the journey that my online presence has taken. I started this blog in 2004, publishing on a Blogger.com site called \"A Logical Waste of Space,\" which was shared with friend of mine. (His stuff is [still there][2].)\n\nOver time, the kinds of things that we wanted to write about diverged, and it made sense for me to split off. For archival purposes, I'll keep [that site][3] around, even though I'm not too proud of some of the dumb stuff I used to write.\n\nThen, I hosted this site on [Squarespace][4] for a while. I like the templates and WYSIWYG design tools that they provide, but felt like my data was trapped. I'm the type of person who likes to work in non-proprietary environments, so I started to look for alternatives.\n\nThe current iteration of this site is built using [Jekyll][5], which is a geek's dream. I'm writing this in a Markdown text file, and Jekyll takes care of compiling it into HTML. I have a [DigitalOcean app][6] pointed at a GitHub repo where these text files live, and it updates the site whenever I make changes. Sure, it takes some coding to customize the look of the site, but hey, I know how to do that stuff! It doesn't even cost anything (unless I get an unexpected uptick in fame).\n\nSo, here I am again.\n\n[1]:\t/blog/2017/03/revive\n[2]:\thttps://logicalwaste.blogspot.com\n[3]:\thttps://fichince.blogspot.com\n[4]:\thttps://albert-choi-p6sw.squarespace.com/\n[5]:\thttps://jekyllrb.com/\n[6]:\thttps://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/",

		"description": "So good it's bad?",
		"content": "Is there such a thing as \"so good it's bad\"?\r\n\r\nWe're all familiar with the inverse, usually in the form of a movie which is so clumsy and inept that it becomes entertaining, in a \"laughing at you, not with you\" kind of way. What would the opposite--\"so good it's bad\"--mean? I believe that I had this experience when I read the legendary It by Stephen King.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that I enjoyed reading this book. I formed a real connection with the characters. My favourite scenes are when the kids are just being kids, joking with each other, building a dam, or running from bullies. I felt like I grew up with them, and when they are reunited in adulthood, I was fascinated with how they ended up and what they've done with their lives, just like I would be if I was reuniting with real people from my real childhood. How did King make me bond with the characters? He did it like any great writer: by giving the characters detailed characteristics and personalities, so that they feel like real people.\r\n\r\nThis attention to detail extends beyond characters, and into the setting as well. The town of Derry is treated to a series of \"interludes\" that separate the main sections of the book. The interludes serve as a history lesson of the town, and also as a way to build the myth of the monster called It. They have the feel of an origin story in a comic book, where the monster and the town itself became linked as a character of its own. By presenting the interludes as the personal journal of Mike, a black man, King even manages to tell an inspirational Civil Rights tale about a military nightclub called The Black Spot.\r\n\r\nThe level of detail is staggering, and it is a strength of the novel. But as I kept turning the pages, I came to see it as a weakness too. To put it bluntly, there is simply too much of a good thing. For example, I wrote down a note to myself at around page 300: \"Eddie and the lobsters.\" After finishing the book, I flipped back to that section to find 4 pages of backstory about Eddie meeting a hobo on the tracks, and obtaining a box of lobsters, and then eating (or not eating) the lobsters, and then being chased by a hobo or something. I had no recollection of this part of the book, because really, it had no bearing on the main plot. After some more flipping, I saw that the lobster/hobo episode is embedded in the middle the story of Eddie's encounter with the It monster, which is itself bookended by the story of Bill telling Eddie and the others about his encounter with the It monster.\r\n\r\nThis form of recursion, flashbacks within flashbacks, backstories within backstories, is a technique that gets used over and over in the novel. King seems to want to leave no gaps; every memory triggers another, as if the characters need a reason for every feeling and recollection that they have. I admire the skill that it must have required for King to pull this off, but the result is that the book became structurally predictable. I felt like I always knew what I was going to get, especially in the second act: this chapter is where Ben sees the monster, and we'll get some backstory about his life; then, the next chapter is now where Stan sees the monster, and we get some backstory about his life. Don't get me wrong, all of the pieces and stories themselves are compelling and enjoyable to read, but in the end, it felt like an album filled with good songs, but they all have the same time signature and chord progressions.\r\n\r\nOne of the plot devices of the book is the fact that the characters in their adulthood have forgotten what happened to them when they were kids, because of the psychic powers of the town and the monster. Given the mystical amnesia, I would have accepted some fuzziness in their memories.\r\n\r\nYou have a great imagination, Mr. King, but please leave some things to ours.",

		"description": "From iPAQ to e-ink",
		"content": "I've had an on-again, off-again relationship with e-books and e-readers for many years. My first experience dates back to the early 2000's. Back then, I had an HP iPAQ Pocket PC device, running some version of Windows CE or Mobile, and read books in an application called Microsoft Reader (with ClearType!). (I won't say \"app\" because that's not what we called them back then.) Books were purchased from the now-defunct Fictionwise store, in an also-defunct format with a \".lit\" filename extension.\n\nI was stunningly ambitious in what I attempted to read. I remember in particular two trilogies: the epic _Neanderthal Parallax_ by Robert J. Sawyer, and the even more epic _Baroque Cycle_ by Neal Stephenson. It was as if I was going for a \"Big Book, Small Screen\" philosophy. These are both trilogies that I have since re-read, having retained very little of my first time with them. From those experiences, I've learned that serious reading is best done with a physical dead-tree book. The tactile experience somehow cements the words in my brain. When I think back on my favourite scenes in books, I can often picture the look of the page: the formatting, typeface, the colour of the covers, even how far down the page my eyes would scan to find the passage.\n\nFast forward a few years, when I picked up my first e-ink device: a Sony Reader. _It looks like paper_, I thought. _My brain will be tricked into thinking it's a real book._\n\nThe Sony's main innovation was a touch screen (prior e-readers had a D-pad or a button on the side for advancing pages), but they implemented it clumsily, using a touch-sensitive plastic layer on top of the e-ink screen. This made the screen a) not all that sensitive to touch, and b) impossible to read off of at certain angles, because of the glare caused by the semi-translucent touch layer. I ditched the device within a few months, and still count it amongst the worst gadget purchases I've ever made.\n\nIn the early 2010's, the [Kobo e-reader](https://www.kobo.com/ca/en/p/ereaders-apps) started showing up front-and-centre at Chapters, my most-visited bookstore (or most visited store of any kind, for that matter). Even though at that point, I was already skeptical of the idea of e-books As A Thing, I bought one because the price was so low.\n\nMy main use case since then has been to borrow e-books from the library. It's a great way to preview books I'm interested in, before buying them. However, the process of borrowing, with its DRM keys and logins and downloads, is just cumbersome enough to mean that my Kobo has spent most of its time on my nightstand beneath a stack of paperbacks.\n\nSometime last year, I ran a software update for my Kobo. The menus were redesigned, and after my initial \"where did all my books go?\" reaction, I noticed a new icon sitting there, sort of a little downwards-pointing chevron thing. It looked familiar, and when I saw the name of the app, \"Pocket,\" the proverbial lightbulb went off.\n\n[Pocket](https://getpocket.com) is a web application that lets you save content from other websites (think newspaper or magazine articles) for reading offline. Say you're browsing on your computer and you come across a nice, long article about marbles or artisanal window blinds or something, but you don't have time to read the whole thing right now. You can click a button in your web browser, and it will save it to your Pocket account. Then, on the phone or tablet app, the text (and maybe some pictures) gets downloaded so that you can read it when the mood strikes, even if you're offline.\n\nI had tried Pocket before (and its main competitor, [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)), but I don't like reading off computer screens. All it did was let me read off a small computer screen instead of a big one.\n\nMaybe you can see where this is going. Magazine articles can usually be read in 15-30 minutes, which is a good sweet spot for filling the gaps that can pop up during the day. Time that I used to spend aimlessly on my phone, scrolling through Facebook, or playing some addictive puzzle game, I now spend reading and hopefully learning something. The content is free--basically anything that is available online--so there's no financial anxiety, and there's no need to set up the DRM stuff that libraries require.\n\nIn short, the addition of Pocket to Kobo has made the device into a portable personalized magazine that I carry with me at almost all times.",

		"content": "I last read _Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell_ in the fall of 2006. The book is somehow linked to memories from that time in my life, so that when I think about the book, it reminds me of events that happened to me, as much as the events that happened in the story itself. For instance, I remember having to buy two copies of it, because one of them was ruined in the rain.[^1] I remember being woken up by a certain hit pop song[^2] on a hotel alarm clock’s radio, and upon hitting the snooze, noticing the book on the nightstand, and wanting to use the snooze interval to squeeze in one more chapter before heading out to work. I remember eliciting a bemused and maybe condescending comment from a desk clerk at a video store[^3]. And I remember, finally, finishing the book on a plane in flight, and then spending the rest of the flight missing it.[^4]\n\nI wonder, this time around, which memories will become entangled with my reading of this book? Will it be reading it while queueing at TIFF 2013, and being disappointed one day when a light rain prevented me from taking it out of my bag?[^5] Will it be my frantic attempt to download an e-book copy from the library on my way out the door somewhere, because I was so desperate to continue reading on the go, but did not want to carry the significant heft of the book?[^6]\n\nWhat it adds up to is an experience that I rarely have with books: that of being so immersed in it that I felt like I was inhabiting the world of the book as much as the real world. Like I was being enchanted by the same spell that the gentleman with thistle-down hair worked on Lady Pole and Stephen Black. Like I was constantly crossing back and forth on the King’s Roads between England and Faerie.\n\nTruly one of my favourite books.\n\n[^1]:\tI had taken it to a dragon boat competition in London, Ontario, as reading material between races, but unfortunately, the weather that day was humid and grey, and the rain soaked through my backpack and into the book, swelling it up like a sponge. The ruined copy had a black cover; its replacement was red. Or maybe vice versa.\n\n[^2]:\tBeyoncé’s “Irreplaceable.”\n\n[^3]:\tHollywood Video at the Pruneyard Shopping Centre, Campbell, CA. I was renting a DVD to watch in the hotel, and was holding the book in my hand. I put it down on the counter to retrieve my wallet, and the clerk said, “Well, that’s a big book.” The video store has now closed down, replaced by something called “Sports Basement,” which has swallowed up the huge space left vacant by the video store, and also, sadly, by a defunct Barnes & Noble bookstore.\n\n[^4]:\tThe trip was for business purposes.\n\n[^5]:\tI was perhaps afraid of rain ruining yet another copy.\n\n[^6]:\tThe whole concept of e-books, especially being available at the public library, would have been quite foreign back in 2006. As foreign as the concept of video stores is, now.",

		"content": "# [_Men at Lunch_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2373324/) & [_The Central Park Five_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380247/)\n\nBy coincidence, I saw these two New York-centric documentaries back-to-back. \n\nThe former is about the famous 1930’s photograph of the construction workers sitting on a steel beam, casually having lunch despite the dangerous position that they’re in. The latter deals with a criminal case in the 1980’s where five teenage boys were wrongly convicted for the sexual assault of a jogger in Central Park.\n\nBoth of them portray New York as a place where many cultures come together, and sometimes clash, but I thought _The Central Park Five_ did a better job of it. The five subjects are all very well-spoken, and through their interviews, you come to understand the racial tension that existed in New York at the time. By the end of the film, it’s a real relief that they were exonerated, but at the same time, you still feel angry and sad that they wasted so many years in prison.\n\n_Men at Lunch_, on the other hand, does not have the same narrative strength. Essentially, it tries to tell the story of who those men on the beam were, but since nobody knows their identities for sure, it settles for making them into symbols of the many Irish immigrants who worked in construction at the time. That’s fine, but the film gets a little repetitive, and keeps telling us how brave they were, how hard life was during the Depression, how the construction workers shaped New York as a city, &c. I found it especially awkward when they tried to draw a connection between those men, and the men who are working now to build the new World Trade Centre tower. The 9/11 scenes seemed a bit out of place and exploitative to me.\n\n**Rating:**\n\n**_Men at Lunch:_ 5/10**\n\n**_The Central Park Five:_ 7/10**\n\n# [_Thale_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2112287/)\n\nTowards the end of the festival, I get a little tired. I might have enjoyed this one more if I saw it earlier in the week. I realize that it’s a low-budget movie, and I respect what they did technically. Thale has some cool horror moments and some cool action moments, but maybe that’s the problem: it doesn’t feel like either a horror film or an action film. I couldn’t really get into the story because I didn’t know what the characters were after. But again, I was pretty tired.\n\n**Rating: 5/10**\n\n# [_Tai Chi 0_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981080/)\n\nThis, on the other hand, was a much more suitable pace for a weary festival-goer. It’s basically a Chinese kung-fu film, mixed with the style of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (e.g., whenever someone does a kung-fu move, the name of the move is shown in stylized text on the screen), with some steampunk thrown in. Cartoonish action at its finest. It’s the first film in a 2-part series, so structurally, it’s a bit off: what you think will be the final battle is actually just setup for the sequel, which makes the previous battle the actual final battle, and a little unsatisfying.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**",

		"content": "I’m going to go with a shorter, “rapid-fire” format today. I’m just tired, okay?\n\n# [_Disconnect_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1433811/)\n\nReading the description, I was a bit concerned that this would turn into a morally unsubtle “the Internet is bad” type of story. I was pleasantly surprised that it doesn’t focus too much on the Internet itself; the Internet just a device to incite events and get the story going, and then mostly stays out of the way. The focus stays on the characters, which is as it should be. The characters sometimes behave in unrealistic ways in order to increase the drama, but I thought it was effective and was caught up in the film.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**\n\n# [_Antiviral_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2099556/)\n\nA lot of the pleasure of watching this film comes from trying to figure out how the premise works. I didn’t read the description beforehand and I don’t know what it gives away, but I’m glad I went in not knowing anything. Unfortunately, once the premise is set up in the first act, the movie didn’t do much to keep me interested. There are some cool and creepy visual moments, but I couldn’t really understand any of the character motivations, and I didn’t really care what happened to them.\n\n**Rating: 5/10**\n\n# [_As If We Were Catching a Cobra_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379718/)\n\nA documentary about political cartoonists working during the Arab Spring sounded like an interesting premise, but the execution was a bit lacking. All the film is is a series of talking-head interviews with various cartoonists and artists. There was nothing really visual or cinematic going on, so it’s just watching people talk and reading lots and lots of subtitles. It was too much for me for an early morning screening, so I walked out, which is a rare occurrence for me. Maybe this material would make for a good book, though.\n\n**Rating: waived because I didn’t see the whole thing. But really it’s like a 3 or a 4.**\n\n# [_The Bay_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1713476/)\n\nI keep telling myself that I’m tired of the whole “found footage” thing whenever I see one (I keep watching them though), but this one felt like a fresh experience. Usually, found footage films have to jump through hoops to justify why there are cameras present, or they just don’t justify it and everyone is left thinking “why don’t you put down the camera?!” the whole time. _The Bay_ avoids this by mixing different camera sources, e.g. A TV news crew, security cameras, police car dashboard cameras. Because of this variety, it often feels more like a well-edited suspense film than a found footage film. It definitely kept me in suspense, although in hindsight, the “monsters” themselves are a little bit silly.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**\n\n# [_Smashed_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2063781/)\n\nGood performances all around, but I thought this story about a young woman with a drinking problem oversimplifies its characters. I didn’t feel like there was much depth to them beyond whether they are drunk or sober, and what they think about other people being drunk or sober.\n\n**Rating: 5/10**\n\n# [_Much Ado About Nothing_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2094064/)\n\nWesley and Fred.

		"description": "_Blancanieves_, _Byzantium_, _No_",
		"content": "# [_Blancanieves_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1854513/)\n\nI’m going to have trouble talking about this film (actually talking, verbally, I mean, not writing about it), because I can’t pronounce the title properly. It’s Spanish for “Snow White.” Maybe I’ll just call it “Snow White,” okay? Okay. So anyway, the movie is an adaptation of the Snow White story, transplanted into 1920’s Spain, and in particular, into the world of matadors. It was the “Golden Age of Bullfighting,” the director said in the Q & A.\n\nThe fairy tale reference is both a benefit and a detriment to the film, in my opinion. While it does add an other-worldly quality to the characters (especially the bullfighting dwarves), some elements felt like they were shoehorned in, like the poison apple, and the eternal slumber. I thought the story was strong enough to stand on its own without having to hang it on the framework of an existing fairy tale.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**\n\n# [_Byzantium_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1531901/)\n\nThere’s something a bit cheesy about the whole vampire thing, and how they’re supposed to be all mysterious and ethereal and romantic. _Byzantium_ has that cheesiness, especially during the flashback scenes, which tell the origin story of the two main vampire characters. The Victoria-era costumes and sets are well-produced, but they’re, you know, cheesy. I think it might have bothered me more if I hadn’t recently been watching a lot of similarly historical scenes done with a lower budget on _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ and _Angel_ (lower budget = more cheesy).\n\nStylistically and visually, I enjoyed the film, but I had some problems with the narrative. The aforementioned flashbacks are interspersed throughout the film, and the origin story arc is supposed to parallel the modern-day storyline. But about halfway through, I had already pieced together the mechanisms of how the characters became vampires, and after that, I was just waiting for what I already knew would happen to play out. As a result, I thought the flashbacks were starting to get in the way of the present narrative, and slowed down what is already a deliberately-paced movie.\n\n**Rating: 6/10**\n\n# [_No_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2059255/)\n\nSpeaking of cheesy, the 80’s were. Cheesy. Specifically, the media output of the 80’s (e.g. TV commercials, movies, etc.), when watched today, can often evoke cringes and bursts of awkward laughter.\n\nThe subject matter of _No_ could have made for a very dark film--it follows a group of advertisers as they create TV commercials encouraging voters to vote against the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile’s 1988 referendum--but the fact that the commercials they create are 80’s commercials adds a lot of humour. There is a real danger involved (any election organized by a dictatorship is going to be fraught with corruption and threats) but when the anti-Pinochet “No” advertisers express their incendiary political ideas of freedom and democracy through commercials featuring dancers dressed in Day-Glo Spandex leotards, backed by synth-pop beats, it’s hard not to laugh at the contrast. The filmmakers behind _No_ have perfectly achieved a balance between humour and solemnity.\n\n**Rating: 8/10**",

		"description": "_Dead Europe_, _The Sessions_, _The Girl from the South_",
		"content": "# [_Dead Europe_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2091880/)\n\nNot too much to say about this one, other than that it’s not very good. The story follows an Australian man as he travels to Greece to spread his immigrant father’s ashes. He discovers some secrets about his father’s past, which are supposed to be dark and troubling, but we never really learn why the father acted the way he did. The film instead relies on some unsubtle arguments between characters to establish that yes, there are disagreements between Palestinians and Jews, and between Catholics and Jews, and that yes, these disagreements are a part of European heritage and history. Then we are just meant to transplant this information into our understanding of the father’s actions, and feel moral outrage or anger or something. But there’s no real connection between the characters and the dreadful racist things they say, so I ended up not feeling anything at all.\n\n**Rating: 4/10**\n\n# [_The Sessions_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1866249/)\n\nNot too much to say about this one either, other than that it’s very funny. The three stars (John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, William H. Macy) are great, and funny. It was so funny that I feel like I missed half the lines in the movie because the sound of the crowd laughing drowned out the dialogue. I should watch this again at home so that I can actually hear what’s being said, and it will probably be even funnier. Did I mention it’s very funny?\n\n**Rating: 8/10**\n\n# [_The Girl from the South_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2330945/)\n\nIf this was a Hollywood biopic and not a documentary, it might have gone a certain way: a youthful, idealistic girl engages in political activism (in this case, it’s for the reunification of Korea); gets the attention of the government in a bad way; overcomes hardships (like being in prison) while continuing to fight for her cause; and eventually becomes a hero, and a symbol for what’s right in the world.\n\nThe beginning of this documentary feels like it’s going to follow that plot. The director, José Luis García, was in North Korea during a youth festival in the 80’s and filmed the “girl from the South”, Lim Su-kyung, during her press conferences and rallies. The archival footage is very well-shot, and I kept wondering why this movie was only being released now. It turns out that the more interesting part of the story occurs in the present day, when the director returns to Korea. I think he is hoping to find that the girl (now woman) is still continuing her activism. While Lim does still do a political radio show on the Internet, she’s become more subdued, and private. She seems not to want to be on camera, and keeps taking the filmmaker to dinners in large groups, so as to avoid talking to him directly. When García finally gets to interview her, it’s like pulling teeth as she keeps deflecting his questions. She certainly still has her political opinions, but she’s no longer the charismatic and gregarious girl that she was as a student.\n\nIn a way, the movie becomes a story of how a person can change. Lim does not live up to the symbol that she was supposed to be. Whether it was the suffering she went through in prison, or the tragic accidental death of a family member, or just age, something changed her and made her into a real person, and not a stock character in a film.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**",

		"description": "_The Deep_, _Shanghai_, _9.79*_",
		"content": "# [_The Deep_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764275/)\n\nWhen I mentioned to my friend that I was seeing an Icelandic movie about the sole survivor of a shipwreck, he said, “So it’s like _Cast Away_, but cold.” For about the first half of the film, this isn’t far from the truth. Following an exciting marine action sequence depicting the accident, we see the man alone in the cold and dark ocean, struggling to swim. The feeling of isolation is very powerful. To combat loneliness, he even talks to a bird (instead of a volleyball). Throw in some _127 Hours_-style flashbacks and hallucinations, and it’s a dramatic, harrowing experience.\n\nThe second half is more subdued, and follows the aftermath of his ordeal. There are two threads going on: one deals with his feelings of survivor’s guilt, and the other deals with the scientific improbability of his survival in low temperatures. Neither of these threads is particularly satisfying (and the latter’s conclusion essentially boils down to this: he’s fat, and that’s why he survived). The aftermath lacks tension, and has the feeling of a denouement, but lasting for half the duration of the film.\n\n**Rating: 6/10**\n\n# [_Shanghai_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2072227/)\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t get to see the whole of this film because I had to get to my next screening. (When planning a schedule for TIFF, I seem to forget that I can’t teleport directly between seats in two non-adjacent theatres.) Therefore, I can only comment on the setup of the film, which isn’t about Shanghai at all, but rather an Indian town that is about to be heavily developed by a large architecture/construction conglomerate. There are those who oppose the builders because the locals will be losing their land, and the leader of this opposition group is involved in a motor vehicle accident which is probably not an accident.\n\nFrom there, a small ensemble of characters try to find out what happened and who’s behind it, &c. (During the investigation, the accident is replayed several times from different perspectives, which I morbidly enjoyed perhaps more than I should have.) The setting, interconnecting plots, and political intrigue reminded me of the novel _Sacred Games_ in a good way.\n\nI guess I can only credit the film for making it hard to leave early. I really wanted to find out what happened...\n\n**Rating: waived**\n\n# [_9.79*_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2318158/)\n\nI’d never seen one before, but I’ve heard that ESPN’s _30 for 30_ documentary series is well worth watching, “even if you don’t like sports,” as is often made a point of. After seeing this film about the 1988 men’s 100m Olympic final, I can see why. It’s well-paced, and combines humour and drama so that by the time the race is shown (for the second time; the film opens with the race, and then repeats it later after introducing the participants and the various relationships and rivalries between them), you really feel what’s at stake, or at least what the runners feel is at stake.\n\nEveryone must have been aware going in to the film that Ben Johnson later lost his medal and record because of his use of P.E.D.s, and in the queue before the movie, my friend and I were talking about who was guilty (Johnson) and who was innocent (Carl Lewis) and how wouldn’t it be ridiculous if Johnson himself showed up for this?\n\n“He would get booed out of the theatre,” I said, and I meant it. He was a cheater and a villain, after all.\n\nTo our surprise, he really did show up for the Q & A after the film, and received a somewhat enthusiastic round of applause. I found myself applauding too. Not that I have any great love for the man, but maybe the film showed that the situation was more complex than I previously thought, and that there were circumstances outside of Ben Johnson’s control, and maybe the morality of sports doping in general is not so black and white anyway, and besides, at least the guy told the truth in the end. To make one rethink one’s assumptions is all one can really ask for from a documentary film.\n\n**Rating: 7/10**",

		"content": "Frankly, I'm surprised I finished this book. I sort of saw it as part of my current project to work my way up to reading _Infinite Jest_. (Which is currently sitting on my dining room table. I'm afraid to shelve it lest the lack of a visual reminder will make me forget that I have it. It is also my hope that visitors will be impressed by the sight of the thing.) \n\nAnyway, I figured I would read a bit of _Everything and More_, see what it's like, and skim through the rest when the math got too hairy. Now, I'm not claiming that I understood all of the math and that it didn't get hairy, or that I never skimmed through any of it at all, but I did follow the general gist for most of the way, or at least enough that I never felt like slamming the book closed and hurling it across the room. \n\nThis I credit to DFW's writing style. I don't think I've ever read anything where the text was so aware of its being read. There are constantly little asides and apologies (many in Wallace's trademark footnotes) about how difficult a particular section is, how you might want to re-read this or that paragraph, how it's all going to be OK in the end. These constant conversational reassurances do a lot to encourage the reader (me, at least) to keep going, despite the difficult math. \n\nAnd there is a suspense to it all too. Cantor is mentioned near the beginning and is set up to be the Hero of the Story, the one whose theories are the ultimate culmination of everything I'm reading, and I genuinely felt the urge to know what Cantor did, like wanting to find out who the killer is in a mystery novel. Wallace does a good job of reminding us how each theory through history will be relevant to Cantor's transfinite numbers, while making each theory interesting to learn about on its own. And while the actual proofs and formulae are explained well, I found the most enjoyment in the connective tissue about the like societal and cultural and historical contexts around each discovery, e.g. the geometric rigidity of the Greeks, the need to develop and accept infinitesimals in physics and science during the time of Newton and Leibniz, &c. I actually wish he had focussed on those contexts more, and I think he probably could have written a thousand-page book (it amazes me how much research must have gone into this as is). I would probably have still read it all.",

		"content": "_Perdido Street Station_ is a great mix of setting, plot and character. I admit that for the first few chapters, I was a little weary. The main plot hadn’t kicked in yet, and I was just getting introduced to the characters, so it felt like the book was spending a lot of time describing the setting. I think it’s a weakness in my reading habits that setting doesn’t capture my attention as much as plot and character development, so I found myself starting to skim over some of the longer descriptive passages. However, the city of New Crobuzon is so unique that whenever my attention started to waver, some imaginative element of the world would pull me back in.\n\nOnce the plot started to get going, it really absorbed me. Almost every scene introduced an interesting new element, which made the world seem like it was constantly expanding.\n\nIf I had one problem with the book, it’s that there were maybe _too many_ ideas. The fantasy setting was established early on, and it’s a world where anything goes, and anything can happen. This was cool most of the time because there was always a sense that something unexpected would happen. However, there were subplots and tangents which seemed to me like they were just put there to introduce a crazy idea. The meeting with the Ambassador from Hell comes to mind; there’s great imagery in that scene, but the character of the Ambassador, and the fact that our protagonists can freely communicate with Hell, never show up again.\n\nThis is a minor criticism, though, and overall, I enjoyed _Perdido Street Station_ very much.",

The first-person narrator and title character is a chimpanzee named Bruno who has learned how to speak. It's clear that from the process of learning language, he has fallen in love with it, so I guess it makes sense that the narrative is written in such a flowery style. It does read well in some parts, but at the same time, it feels like the author is trying too hard to use big words.\n\nIt was nearer to the end when I started to lean more towards frustration. Bruno's friend Leon is introduced. I expected that the dialogue between the two would take a more casual tone than Bruno's elaborate first-person narration. After all, no one talks like that in real life. But, it turns out that Leon is a _Shakespearean actor_, and he _does_ talk like that.\n\nI realize that in the world of the story, this can be explained by saying that Bruno's speaking style throughout the entire narrative is influenced by his time with Leon. That makes logical sense, but it was still a decision by the author to have them talk that way. It made Leon seem not like a real character, but rather a device to deliver more fancy writing.\n\nThe book worked best when it focussed on Bruno's icky but somehow touching relationship with Lydia. Unfortunately, it lost me once it became about his adventures with Leon. I would like to judge the book as a whole, but this is a case where the final impressions took away from my earlier enjoyment.",

Bizarrely, the employees were crammed into the elevator lobby because we had no meeting rooms large enough to hold us all. The CEO was giving his inspirational forecast for the company:\n\n“In five years, we’ll be the market leader. And our competitors... they’ll be working at Dunkin’ Donuts! BWAHAHAHA!!”\n\nA handful of high-ranking execs managed some forced laughter, but most of us had no response except to look around at each other in shock. I thought to myself, “Yeah, this guy’s a psychopath.”)\n\nWhen I started reading the book, I was expecting a direct, focussed attack on the rich and powerful, which by the end would have me marching into my CEO’s office, with an outraged mob rallying behind me.\n\nTo my surprise, Ronson pretty much abandons his thesis halfway, after interviewing Al Dunlap, a disgraced CEO. The evidence wasn’t strong enough to declare Dunlap a psychopath. At this point, I could see that Ronson was struggling to keep his book on track. The point that he was trying to make had basically fallen apart.\n\nTo his credit, Ronson manages to recover. He changes gears, and looks into how our culture is fascinated by madness. A reality show producer that he interviews says that there’s a certain type of crazy that we enjoy watching, because it makes us feel happy to be normal. (If only there was a word to express the feeling of taking pleasure in someone else’s misfortune...)\n\nI think some readers will call this a cop-out, but I liked how he rebounds from his failed quest by questioning his motives for undertaking the quest in the first place. The fact that he wanted to uncover hidden psychopaths means that he’s part of the madness industry.\n\nEntertainment, such as reality shows and books about psychopathic world leaders, is one side of the madness industry, but Ronson also covers a more serious side: overdiagnosis of mental illness and overprescription of drugs.\n\nBy ending on that note, I think Ronson is making a profound point: that the true madness in the world is seeing madness where it doesn’t exist.",

		"description": "After that it's just a chase scene",
		"content": "_Reamde_ represents the first time that I have been disappointed with a Neal Stephenson book.  \n  \nBefore I get into it, I’ll start by saying that Stephenson is my favourite author. _Snow Crash_ became one of my favourite books as soon as I read it, and remains a novel that I feel like reading once every couple years. His essay “In the Beginning...was the Command Line” (which has now been published as a book), influenced my own personal computing habits, and encouraged me to learn Linux. Even though current technology has made the essay obsolete, the ideas contained within it still inform my views on computers.  \n  \nThe common thread that runs through my love of Stephenson’s work is his presentation of new ideas. He likes to spit out long infodumps on nerdy details that connect tangentially to the plot (Sumerian history and mythology in _Snow Crash_, the mathematics of encryption in _Cryptonomicon_) and every time he does, I eat it up. I basically feel like I’m learning something, and as deluded as I may be for thinking that I can get an education by reading fiction, it’s very satisfying for me.  \n  \nAt first, _Reamde_ gave me what I wanted: it takes the familiar MMORPG concept and adds some neat ideas. There’s also some geeky humour about the placement of apostrophes in the nomenclature of the game’s fantasy setting.  \n  \nThe problems start about a quarter of the way in, when the book turns into an action thriller. Aside from a couple of scenes where some characters meet up and communicate in the online game world, the cool ideas that got me hooked at the beginning are mostly abandoned. The plot revolves around a terrorist plot, and the secret and not-so-secret agents who try to stop the terrorists. In other words, it’s like a really long season of _24_ (not my favourite show in the world).  \n  \nWhen the action ramped up, I assumed that it was just a small scene that would bridge into the second part of the novel. Instead, the action pretty much continues for the rest of the way. It’s like the climax starts a quarter of the way in, and encompasses three-quarters of the book.  \n  \nI don’t mind action, and Stephenson writes it well, but it really feels like a slog when the book is a thousand pages long. Each chapter takes place in one day and are titled as such (e.g. Day 1, Day 15). The “Day 4” chapter lasts for 200+ pages on its own (about 20-25% of the total length). It took me almost a week to get through it and I eventually started thinking to myself, “These characters are _still_ in pretty much the same situation that I was reading about three days ago!”  \n  \nLet me contrast this with the way Stephenson treated action in his earlier work. This sentence ends a chapter in _Snow Crash_:  \n  \n> After that--after Hiro gets onto his motorcycle, and the New South Africans get into their all-terrain pickups, and The Enforcers get into their slick black Enforcer mobiles, and they all go screaming out onto the highway--after that it’s just a chase scene.\n  \nTo me, this is a very clever way to jump forward in time. The narrator is breaking the fourth wall and telling the audience, “We all know what a chase scene is, so let’s not dwell on it.” Now, imagine replacing this line with 200+ pages of actually describing all the things that happen in the chase scene and you have _Reamde_.  \n  \nTo sum up, I still did enjoy Stephenson’s writing style and humour, but it went on way too long. Too much action and plot, not enough ideas. I’ve pretty much read all of his books more than once, but I don’t see myself coming back to _Reamde_ anytime soon.",

		"content": "I’ve spent most of my life at the intersection of Eastern and Western cultures. When I stumbled upon this book, it made me wonder where I stood. Would my way of thinking match up with one side or the other?  \n  \nOne of the book’s main points is that Eastern cultures value interdependence over independence; that is, people are seen as part of a group. Western cultures, on the other hand, are more individualistic; success is measured by personal achievement.  \n  \nCoincidentally, not long after I finished the book, I had a conversation with my grandma that perfectly illustrates this point. We were talking about work, and I mentioned how my company might be moving offices soon. My Cantonese language skills aren’t the best, so sometimes there’s miscommunication when I speak to my grandma; she thought I had said that I was changing jobs. When I cleared up the misunderstanding, she seemed relieved.  \n  \nShe said that it’s not right to change jobs, because you’ve formed attachments to the people there and it would be hard to leave. This is not something that I’m used to hearing; often, I get advice that changing jobs will help you get ahead and will be good for your career. I might have been confused by my grandma’s words, but seen in the light of what I had just read in the book, it made perfect sense.  \n  \nFor her, work is about being part of a group, one that is not easy to separate yourself from. According to Nisbett, this is classic Eastern philosophy. The opposing viewpoint--that changing jobs is a positive move--is more in line with Western thought because it encourages individual growth.  \n  \nI wasn’t aware that this was a cultural difference, but I know that whenever I imagine myself changing jobs, I always feel conflicted about the idea. On the one hand, there is a sense of guilt that I would be abandoning my team and letting them down. On the other hand, I tell myself that it’s a case of misplaced loyalty: it’s not personal, it’s just business.  \n  \nI think these two parts of my thought process directly correspond to East and West. Having been exposed to both sides for most of my life, I’m not always aware of where that line is. Now that I’ve read this book, I think I’ll be better able to understand where my instincts come from, and be better able to choose from the best of both worlds.",

		"description": "Cognitive dissonance",
		"content": "Before reading this book, I had been aware of the ideas of cognitive dissonance and self-justification, having encountered them in some day-to-day personal interactions, mostly related to money. (“X is good, and I want it, but I don’t want to spend so much money on X... therefore, X is no good and I don’t want it!”)  \n  \nThis book studies dissonance in larger real-world situations where the stakes are much higher. Through examples about corrupt politicians, false memories, police interrogations, and others, we see how powerful a force cognitive dissonance can be. The more wrong you are about something, the harder you’ll try to convince yourself that you’re not wrong. This leads to decisions that can harm many people.  \n  \nThis was an enlightening read, but disturbing at the same time. I came away from it with a hopeless feeling. There don’t seem to be any solutions for the problem other than people realizing and admitting to their mistakes, but if self-justification is so ingrained in our minds, how would this actually happen? I don’t know.",

		"description": "_ALPS_, _A Letter to Momo_, _Violet & Daisy_, _Martha Marcy May Marlene_, _Take Shelter_",
		"content": "# 5. [_ALPS_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1859446/)\n  \nI was looking forward to _ALPS_ because I enjoyed the director’s last film, _[Dogtooth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1379182/)_, which I saw two years ago at TIFF. Where _Dogtooth_ combined disturbing and uncomfortable content with some bizarre comedy in a stylistic way, _ALPS_ tries to be more realistic and grounded. It still has some oddly funny moments, though; my biggest laugh was the “Prince and Bruce Lee” scene which comes out of nowhere.  \n  \nI thought the ending of the film had depth. The main character’s actions come together to explain her earlier (often strange) behaviour, revealing something about her past in a subtle way. It’s hard to discuss without spoiling it, so I’ll leave it as a vague as that.  \n  \n# 4. [_A Letter to Momo_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853614/)\n  \nProbably the funniest movie I saw this year. The story was like a combination of _[My Neighbour Totoro](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/)_, _[Spirited Away](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/)_, and _[Princess Mononoke](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/)_. I fully acknowledge that it’s derivative and a little sappy, but I’m a sucker for silly anime comedy sometimes. Most of the laughs come from a trio of mythical creatures, who have a pretty cool and unique character design. The main character’s grief and guilt over her father’s death gives it some heart-warming moments between the comedy.  \n\n# 3. [_Violet & Daisy_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634136/)\n  \nI think one of the main hurdles for enjoying this film is accepting that the two title characters could exist. I don’t just mean in a practical sense; obviously, no one would actually hire two teenage girls to be assassins in real life. I think the suspension of disbelief has to go further than what would or wouldn’t happen in the real world; it has to go into the psychology of the characters as well. If you can accept that the girls can go from shooting multiple villains in one moment, and then giggling about getting a pretty new dress in the next, then there’s a lot to enjoy here.  \n  \nObviously, since I’m putting it this high on my list, I was able to suspend my disbelief. The biggest factor in my getting absorbed into the film was Saoirse Ronan’s performance. Between this film and _[Hanna](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993842/)_, I’ve become a fan of hers. In both films, she’s a girl killer, but she combines innocence and menace in a different way; in _Hanna_, it’s almost like she’s autistic and has trouble processing her perception of the world, except when she’s killing people; in _Violet & Daisy_, she uses dark humour to bring out the conflicting sides of her character.\n  \n# 2. [_Martha Marcy May Marlene_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441326/)\n  \nI read a review of this film where the writer says that he would not want to watch it a second time, because of its unsettling nature. I partially agree with that assessment. It is an unsettling film, but the reason that I wouldn’t want to rewatch it is because it would lose its sense of mystery. Much of the enjoyment of watching this film was due to the suspense of not knowing what would happen next, and what happened before. Now that I know what happens, I don’t think a second viewing would be as satisfying.  \n  \nWhat might bring me back is the lead performance by Elizabeth Olsen. She’s very quiet throughout, but there’s a feeling that she could explode and lash out at any moment.  \n  \n# 1. [_Take Shelter_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675192/)\n  \nAs I was watching, I kept changing my mind about what the theme of the movie was. Is it about a man dealing with mental illness? Is it about a man trying to convince an unbelieving community about an impending danger? The strength of the film is that even the main character doesn’t know any more than the audience does. He reacts to his visions as if they were true, but at the same time being aware that doing so is a sign of schizophrenia. This ambiguity is portrayed very well by Michael Shannon, and makes for a very moving climax.  \n  \nThis film also contained some of the most effective special effects I’ve seen. They’re subtle and come at unexpected moments between quieter scenes. It’s a relief from the heavy special effects that we often see in big blockbusters.",

		"description": "_From Up on Poppy Hill_, _Take This Waltz_, _The Awakening_, _Warriors of the Rainbow_, _Tahrir 2011_",
		"content": "# 10. [_From Up on Poppy Hill_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798188/)\n  \nThere’s nothing too groundbreaking about this story. Girl meets boy, but something keeps them apart, until it doesn’t anymore. It wraps up a little too neatly, but I don’t mind a happy ending. The best thing about it was the backdrop of the high school clubhouse. It’s a visually interesting setting, filled with some entertaining secondary characters.  \n  \n# 9. [_Take This Waltz_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1592281/)\n  \nI liked the Toronto-ness of the movie, and the colourful cinematography. It has some funny moments, but ultimately, a story about relationship stuff is not my cup of tea. It was the best Q & A session of the festival for me, with Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman in attendance. They’re very funny. For example, and I paraphrase:  \n  \nQuestion: “How do you comedic actors adjust to more dramatic roles?”  \n  \nSarah Silverman: “Well, I _am_ capable of just saying words...”  \n  \n# 8. [_The Awakening_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1687901/)\n  \nThis ghost movie has some good scares, especially one creepy scene involving a doll house. The supporting characters are a little one-dimensional, and for some reason, they each have a weird physical quirk; one guy is constantly coughing, one guy wears fake glasses, one guy has a limp _and_ a stutter (Dominic “McNulty” West (man crush?)). I liked the lead character and performance by Rebecca Hall; she’s like a 1920’s version of Scully from _The X-Files_.  \n  \n# 7. [_Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2007993/)\n  \nIn some ways, it’s a typical war movie, with some spectacular big battle scenes, usually preceded by a dramatic speech. On the other hand, it inverts a common cliché: normally, we’re used to seeing WWII Japanese as fierce and brutal; here, they’re depicted as cold and strategic, and they’re the ones calling their Seediq opponents “savages.”  \n  \nThis was a rare occasion where I wanted a movie to be longer. I had trouble distinguishing between different characters because they’re not given much time to establish their personalities. As it turns out, the film was released in two parts in Taiwan, with a total runtime of four and half hours. They edited it down for the North American release, and I assume they kept more of the action scenes. I think it will be worth re-watching in its entirety.  \n  \n# 6. [_Tahrir 2011: The Good, the Bad, and the Politician_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044012/)\n  \nCoincidentally, both documentaries I saw have a variation of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” as the subtitle. It makes more sense for this film than it does for _I’m Carolyn Parker_, because it’s actually divided into three segments, made by three directors. My favourite part was the second. “The Bad” refers to the officers who were responsible for policing the crowd during the protests in Egypt. Calling them “bad” is almost ironic, because it doesn’t pass judgement, and the segment ends on a morally ambiguous note.  \n  \nThe middle section is sandwiched by two parts which are polar opposites of each other, stylistically and emotionally. The first part uses raw footage and just shows what happened in the protests. It felt like being there, and it was quite stressful to watch. In contrast, the third part is a satirical portrait of Mubarak, played for laughs. It ends the film on a more “fun” note, and relieves the tension built up by the first two parts.",

		"content": "# 15. [_Ten Year_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1715873/)\n  \nIt had some good laughs and an impressive cast, but the story is quite predictable, and it really strains believability that so many attractive people would be in the same high school class. Especially in a small town. No offense to people who live in small towns.  \n\n# 14. [_Trishna_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1836987/)\n  \nThe improvised dialogue was a little awkward at times. Also, the title character is too passive; she goes through most of the movie just saying “OK,” and “Yes, sir.” The director said that her passivity was intentional; be that as it may, it’s frustrating to watch. The cinematography is beautiful, and shows India in a very realistic way.\n  \n# 13. [_I’m Carolyn Parker: The Good, the Mad, and the Beautiful_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1872083/)\n  \nThis documentary really makes you feel the effects of Hurricane Katrina, not just in the immediate aftermath, but for several years afterwards, all the way up to now. It might have made for a depressing film, but Carolyn Parker has a big personality and it’s just fun to watch and listen to her talk.\n\n# 12. [_The Sword Identity_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044077/)\n  \nThe key to enjoying this martial arts movie is suspension of disbelief. In this world, people can easily knocked unconscious by a single blow, and it’s possible to fight off waves of attackers by hiding behind a curtain. It’s not your typical kung fu movie in that it doesn’t focus on the fights and the choreography. The fight scenes are over in a flash and some of them even happen off-screen. It’s really about what the fights mean to the characters; all of them have strong ideals about honour and justice, and that’s what lifts the film above the ridiculousness of the action.  \n  \n# 11. [_Machine Gun Preacher_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1586752/)\n  \nAs a non-religious person, I had a bit of trouble getting excited about the main character’s initial transformation from ex-con to preacher. I can’t fault the film for that if it’s true to the real-life story; it’s just not something I can identify with. It’s not a problem once he starts fighting for African orphans because religion is pretty much out of the picture in those situations. Gerard “Tonight We Dine in Hell” Butler gives an intense performance, but I wish he had done it all in his native Scottish accent, authenticity be damned.",

		"content": "TIFF is over and I’m only now starting to process all the films I saw. Over the next week or so, I’ll count down the movies that I saw, and give a short review of each one.  \n  \nSo, let’s start at the bottom of the list. Except for the two worst entries, even this lowest stratum of films held my interest and gave me something to think about. I’m just open-minded that way.  \n  \n# -. [_The Story of Film: An Odyssey_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2044056/)\n  \nI’m not including this in the ranking because I didn’t see the whole thing, and it’s not really a movie. It’s a 15-hour documentary, more like a miniseries than a feature. They were showing it in segments, and it was free, so I decided to pop in on the last day. It’s not hard to describe: imagine watching short scenes from many films, while a guy with a cool Irish accent describes what’s interesting about each one, and why it’s significant in the history of cinema. I got so hooked that I skipped another film, and stayed until the end of this one. I might watch the rest of it on DVD one day.  \n  \n# 19. [_The Moth Diaries_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1407065/)\n  \nJust because the word “Diaries” is in the title, doesn’t mean you can constantly rely on diary voiceovers to advance the plot. At one point, the main character writes in her diary, “That girl is weird, she must be a vampire!” and we’re supposed to go along with it completely. It would have been far more effective to leave some doubt for the audience, and drop some hints along the way instead of telling us outright what the main character is thinking.  \n  \n# 18. [_Mr. Tree_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2043878/)\n  \nMy biggest problem with this film is that the title character’s quirky stupidity is inconsistent. In some moments, he seems to be mentally disabled, and in others, he’s writing extremely poetic text messages. On top of that, the main conflict of the story doesn’t really kick in until 15-20 minutes before the end, so it really drags on in the middle.  \n  \n# 17. [_Among Us_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1630562/)\n  \nI think this is a film that tries to replace drama with structure. It shows the story three times from the perspective of different characters, and it keeps you guessing because each viewpoint is incomplete. However, while watching it, my mind started to mentally re-edit the film in chronological order. If seen in that order, I think it would be clear that nothing really compelling actually happens.  \n\n# 16. [_The Loneliest Planet_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695405/)\n\nI liked the idea behind this film, which is basically about how one event can change a relationship. The event occurs near the half-way point, which divides the movie into “before” and “after” halves. The crucial moment is depicted really well. However, the film is two hours long; I think a 90-minute runtime have sufficed to tell the story. Also, Gael Garcia Bernal (man crush?) doesn’t get to do much except for walking and looking sad.",

		"description": "_Girlfriend_, _Fire of Conscience_",
		"content": "# [_Girlfriend_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1470859/)\n\nThe story follows a man with Down's syndrome living in a small town. The actor had good screen presence and was quite funny in many of the scenes; it's not often you see a developmentally challenged person in a lead role in a film, so I appreciated his efforts. Because I'm not used to seeing a character like this, it kept the movie interesting in what would otherwise be a somewhat standard soap opera plot. The ending was controversial because of the actions of the titular girlfriend that our protagonist is romantically pursuing. I know it was controversial because it prompted perhaps the silliest audience question I've ever heard in a director Q&A session: \"Why did it end like that?\"\n\n**3 out of 5**\n\n# [_Fire of Conscience_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1602500/)\n\nHong Kong action movie in the vein of John Woo's classics. While not as over the top as Woo's films, it still had some decent shoot-out scenes and an engaging detective story. The highlight was a totally random childbirth sequence in the midst of explosions and fire. The experience was also made more entertaining by the man sitting in our row who would bust out in raucous laughter whenever grenades appeared on screen. Apparently an aficionado of grenade-related humour.\n\n**2.5 out of 5**\n\n---\nAnd that's it until next year.",

		"content": "# [_The Butcher, the Chef, and the Swordsman_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1722513/)\n  \nAnother Chinese martial arts fantasy, but was short on the martial arts. It used a nesting story-in-a-story-in-a-story structure, with each level of the story centering on each of the titular characters, and their involvement with a magical cleaver. Allow me to demonstrate by structuring my review in the same way:  \n  \n- _The Butcher:_ Didn't enjoy this character because he was very cartoonish and annoying. At this point, I was not aware that there would be an embedded story, so I was quite relieved when we were introduced to...  \n\n\t- _The Chef:_ Probably my favorite part of the movie. It was told in the style of more traditional folklore and toned down the cartoonishness that in my opinion plagued the first part. Which brings us to...\n\n\t\t- _The Swordsman:_ Took on an even more gritty tone, which kind of made it boring. Thankfully, it didn't last too long before we returned to...\n\n\t- _The Chef:_ After having seen each of the three segments, I realized that the Chef portions struck the right balance between humor and seriousness.

The movie itself was a pleasant, if clichéd, tale of a musician in a band who discovers that he has a teenage daughter who he has never met. Their relationship grows and he learns valuable lessons about life, blah blah blah. I might have liked it less if the director hadn't introduced it and mentioned that he met his daughter as a teenager, and based the movie on that. This gave it a more personal context which changed the way I viewed the film.  \n  \n**2.5 out of 5**\n\n---\n\nThere will be one more post.",

Very character-focussed and tried to depict the relationships, friendly and otherwise, between the sailors on the ship. It works up to a point, but after a while, you realize that nothing is happening in the movie except for a bunch of guys hanging out on a boat. It really went downhill for me when they tried to put in an antiwar message near the end by having one of the characters go through an arbitrary and dramatic emotional change. One positive note: the crew has a dog for a pet and he is cute.\n  \n**1.5 out of 5**  \n  \n# [_Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1123373/)\n  \nMy friend told me that this Chinese martial arts fantasy was originally meant to be in 3D. It definitely showed up in many of the more spectacular special effects shots as they used camera angles and moves that you wouldn't normally see in conventional cinema. Beyond the visuals, however, this film didn't offer much else. The plot's central mystery started off interestingly enough in an Indiana Jones supernatural kind of way, but soon got way too convoluted for its own good.

		"description": "Like poetry",
		"content": "[_Confessions_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1590089/) kicks off with an extended monologue given by a schoolteacher whose daughter has drowned in a swimming pool. She gradually and coldly reveals that students in her class are responsible for her child’s death. The students act like typical apathetic teenagers, laughing and texting through the whole thing. As I was watching this, I wondered where the film was going to lead. Would it keep the structure of the opening sequence and have the teacher tell the story in flashback? Or would it switch to a more conventional route and show the consequences of the girl’s death? As it turns out, I could never have guessed where it was going to go.  \n  \nIf serialized TV series can be likened to novels, and movies are analogous to short stories, then _Confessions_ is like poetry. It never adheres to a linear narrative, instead jumping between chapters that play like psychological profiles of the various characters in the film. At the same time, the plot reveals itself one fragment at a time, until a clear picture forms of the twisted schemes of the teacher and her students. There are no innocent characters in this film; everyone is motivated by some dark internal forces.  \n  \nI admit that during the more abstract sections of _Confessions_, I tuned out slightly; being accustomed to more structured narratives, I found it hard to pay attention when it didn’t feel like the plot was being advanced in some way. However, I realized afterwards that those scenes would pop back into my memory, and it was because the visuals that they present would draw parallels to more significant scenes in other parts of the movie. For example, there is an image that sticks in my head of the students splashing through rain puddles in slow-motion. On its own, you might call it pointless, but later on, the schoolteacher character experiences a cathartic moment in a scene that has a similar visual palette.  \n  \nGenerally, I subscribe to the idea that the more you remember and contemplate a movie after watching it, the better it is. In that sense, _Confessions_ was the best movie I saw at TIFF this year, because it was with me for days, and I’m really looking forward to seeing it again.  \n  \n**4.5 out of 5**  \n  \n_N.B. I don’t automatically like a movie just because it has a Radiohead song in it. To avoid accusations of same, I hereby relegate to a footnote the brilliant use of the song “Last Flowers” in a couple of key scenes of this movie. That is all._",

		"description": "Dramatic self-reference",
		"content": "In [_Even the Rain_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1422032/), a Spanish film crew, lead by the director Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal), travels to Bolivia to shoot a movie about Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World. Structurally, it brings to mind some of Larry David’s more self-referential moments, but in a dramatic, instead of comedic, context. (Think the fourth season of _Seinfeld_, where Jerry and George create a show within a show, or the seventh season of _Curb Your Enthusiasm_, where at one point, Larry David plays himself playing himself.) There are extended scenes of _Even the Rain_ that essentially show the finished product of what the Columbus film would look like. It's a credit to the filmmaking that these scenes carry an emotional impact even though that we know that, as a movie within a movie, it’s two levels removed from reality and requires double suspension of disbelief.  \n  \nOf course, if the movie relied on an interesting structure alone, it would devolve into gimmick. Thankfully, _Even the Rain_ effectively uses the layered structure to reflect the different attitudes of the characters and the ethical issues of the situation they find themselves in. It's clear that Sebastian's goal for his Columbus film is to denounce the mistreatment and exploitation of the Native Americans while lionizing the Spanish priests who defended the Natives' rights. At the same time, the film crew hires local Bolivians of Native descent as extras, and brag to their producers about having cheap labour. In other words, the themes of the film they're making reflect and contrast against the themes of the film that we, the audience, are watching.  \n  \nIn particular, the character of the actor who plays Christopher Columbus in the inner film is very complex and multidimensional. As Columbus, he is completely inconsiderate towards the Natives, which is what the role requires. In his interactions with the other actors who play the heroic priests, he is callously skeptical of their idealism and doubts if they truly believe the same things that their characters believe. However, as the conflict with the Natives escalates, he shows yet another side to himself that was previously unexpected.  \n  \nAll in all, _Even the Rain_ was entertaining and thought-provoking. It becomes a bit generic towards the climax, but I enjoyed the first act so much that it earns its melodramatic ending.  \n  \n**4 out of 5**",

		"content": "The [promotional](http://www.the-match-factory.com/films/items/the-hunter.html) [materials](http://www.the-match-factory.com/films/items/the-hunter.html?file=assets/downloads-public/films/t/the-hunter/the-hunter-pressbook.pdf) for [_The Hunter_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190072/) emphasize the events that occur in the latter half of the film. Without going into spoilers, I can say that this is a reasonable decision from the marketers because the second half does sound pretty exciting. However, I think to focus on the thriller-esque plot points is slightly misleading and sets up some undue expectations. After reading the official synopsis, and especially after the hard guitar rock accompaniment of the opening credit sequence, I was ready for an energetic crime film, and that’s not what _The Hunter_ delivers.\n  \nI know it’s unfair to judge a movie by its promotional materials, and I don’t intend to do so. In fact, after I had settled into the slower-than-expected pacing, I found a lot to like about the film. The cinematography stands out the most; there were many well-composed shots that you could take a still frame and hang on a wall. The camera effectively captures both the grays of the urban environment of Tehran and the greens of the forest that is the setting for the latter parts of the film.  \n  \nThe director and writer, Rafi Pitts, also stars in the lead role. His performance, on the surface, is very stoic; you might even say stone-faced or boring. But I think he does a good job of conveying a quiet rage and sadness beneath the surface, especially in the scene where he is first notified of his wife’s death. He plays it as if he’s almost about to break down in an emotional outburst, and sustains it throughout the lengthy scene.  \n  \nThe main flaw I found with _The Hunter_ was with the plotting in the second half. For long stretches, we lose sight of the main character and the story shifts to the police officers who are pursuing him. Many political themes are brought up at this point, but I didn’t think the moralizing fit in with the mood of the first half so I found it more distracting than thought-provoking. In the end, style won over substance, but in a good way.  \n  \n**3 out of 5**",

		"description": "Autism and skepticism",
		"content": "When I first looked at the schedule for TIFF (seems like so long ago), [_The Sunshine Boy_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1343113/) was one of the first movies that caught my eye. I've always been interested by the subject of autism. I think it's because I like to learn about how different people experience the world in different ways. It's hard to imagine how someone with autism perceives their environment, which is exactly why I find it fascinating.  \n  \nThe film is a documentary which follows the mother (Margrét Dagmar Ericsdóttir) of an autistic boy, as she interviews experts and other parents of autistic children, while trying to find some way of improving her son Keli's life. The film does a good job of mixing educational material with more personal stories so that it doesn't devolve into information overload. It's shot beautifully, especially the scenes showing the family exploring various Icelandic landscapes. As an added bonus, the film uses songs by Sigur Rós as background music throughout; they're one of my favourite bands and I thought the music suited the movie well.  \n  \nTo me, the driving force of the film is Margrét's desire to get to know her son. Keli's autism is quite severe and he is non-verbal, so I believe that the family saw him, understandably, in terms of his disorder, rather than who he was as a person. As she meets other families who have been able to learn to communicate with their autistic kids, she starts to hope for the same thing with Keli, and this hope transfers to the viewer.  \n  \nMargrét eventually chooses to explore a teaching and communication technique called [Rapid Prompting Method](http://www.halo-soma.org/) (RPM). The method was developed by a woman named Soma Mukhopadhyay to communicate with her own autistic son, and involves the child spelling out words by pointing at a board with letters on it. (It's more complicated than that, but that is the ultimate goal that they work towards.)  \n  \nThis is where my feelings got a little ambiguous. I'm a skeptic at heart, and I began to doubt the authenticity of RPM and the letter board technique. In all the scenes where they showed the kids \"speaking\" with the letter board, Soma is holding the board. It almost seems as if she is moving the board as much as the kids are pointing to it. How much is Soma leading it or at least anticipating what the kids are going to say? Is she using the film to sell her method by making it look more effective than it really is?  \n  \nMy ambivalence and doubt reached its peak in one scene which could be considered the climax of the movie. We see Keli talking with Soma through the letter board while Margrét watches. The scene is either one of the most moving scenes I've seen in a while, or a somewhat exploitative fabrication, depending on whether I believe that RPM is what it claims to be.  \n  \nI have been swinging back and forth between these two positions since I saw the film. When I was sitting, watching in the theatre, I had on my skeptical hat and was dismissive of the scene. However, when I got home and lay in bed trying to fall asleep, I thought back to it and changed my mind a little. There certainly is a lot of power in the words that Keli says, which, when coupled with the Sigur Rós song ([\"Ára bátur\"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NecFN-cfwlk)) playing in the background, brought me close to tears just from thinking about it. (I won't reveal what he says because I think it needs to be experienced by watching the film.)  \n  \nIn the end, though, I don't believe that there's any black and white way of judging a teaching system or technique, and I'm sure that it works better for some people than others. My skepticism doesn't take away from what I think is the main message of the film: that autistic kids are capable of more than their condition would seem to allow on the surface, and that there is hope for reaching them through various techniques. Whether or not I fully buy into RPM in particular, the film is very informative and thought-provoking.  \n  \n**3.5 out of 5**",

		"description": "Horror and style",
		"content": "When I think about [City of Life and Death](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124052/), two scenes stand out in my mind. In the first scene, the camera follows a Japanese soldier as he walks up a hill and looks down. The camera continues to move upward to show what the soldier sees on the field below: the bodies of Chinese POWs that the Japanese troops have just killed in a mass execution. The second stand-out scene shows a firing squad execution of a Chinese man, softly focused in the background, while a Japanese soldier's face is shown in the foreground. The composition of the frame is phenomenal.  \n  \nBoth scenes depict horrible events in a visually stylish way, which pretty much sums up the movie for me. The film is about the Nanking Massacre, an event that took place just before WWII. The Japanese Army invaded the city in China and committed many atrocities there. For a movie like this, it's hard to separate the heavy subject matter from the artistry of the filmmaking. I don't really want to tackle _what_ the film is about. Many words [have been written](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-rape-of-nanking-the/9780465068364-item.html) about the topic and I don't think I have anything to add to that discussion.  \n\nWhat I want to focus on is _how_ the movie addresses the subject matter. First of all, the black and white cinematography is simply stunning. The set design is very realistic, and it really makes you feel like you're there.\n\nSo what does it feel like to be there? For the first third or half of the movie, I had a very uneasy feeling because I was anticipating what horrors were going to happen next. Being familiar with the history, I went into the movie expecting to see shocking images. Sure enough, it is very uncomfortable to watch, but actually not as graphic as I expected. The emotional impact comes more from the suggestion of what's going on rather than showing it, and in that way, it's very effective. For example, one scene shows a mass shooting of Chinese POWs, but only in brief glimpses. The film spends much more time showing the reactions of the other inhabitants of the city to the sound of guns they hear in the distance.\n\nFor the latter parts of the movie, my sense of uneasiness died down and was replaced by numbness. The movie is so unrelenting in portraying one unpleasant situation after another that after a while you just have to block it out and stop thinking about it. The performances of the characters in the movie seem to become increasingly hopeless and lifeless. Basically, the only thing I felt was lack of feeling, which is what I think the film is going for in depicting the stress and trauma of war.\n\nThis is one of those movies that's difficult to watch, but I would like to see it again. I feel like I should have deeper opinions about it, but as I said, all I felt was numb in the end. Maybe on a second viewing, I'll be more able to absorb it. All in all, it was a powerful experience.\n\n**4 out of 5**",

		"description": "Communication barrier",
		"content": "[_The Warrior and the Wolf_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1300169/) was a Chinese historical drama. The titular warrior hides out in a village during a break in the battle and meets a woman in the village and they develop a relationship. \"The wolf\" could metaphorically refer to any number of things and is open to interpretation, so I won't give anything away by discussing it.  \n  \nI'm not quite sure what to make of this one. While I found the basic plot satisfying, and the visuals nice to look at (especially one special effects shot of a desert sandstorm), there were some issues with the film that prevented me from really getting into it. First, I had a problem with the introduction in the first 20 minutes or so. It attempts to give the background of the war and the warrior's involvement in said war in a non-linear way. It jumps back and forth in time and I had a hard time following what the current storyline was. I don't have a problem with non-linear storytelling, but to use it to establish the foundation for the rest of the film didn't work, and it affected the experience for the remainder.  \n  \nThe other big problem I had was with the relationship between the warrior and the village woman. It reminded me of the flashback sequence in _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ (which was my least favourite part of that film). Boy meets girl, boy holds girl captive, boy rapes girl, girl inexplicably comes to love boy. Obviously within that culture and in that historical time period, gender roles were different, but I just couldn't believe in that relationship.  \n  \nAt the end of the film, there was a Q & A session with the director and main cast. Someone asked a question regarding how the two stars of the film ([Maggie Q](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702572/) and [Joe Odagiri](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643885/)) and the director ([Tian Zhuang Zhuang](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0862514/)), who all speak a different native language, dealt with the communication barrier on set. The gist of their answers was that it wasn't a barrier, and that the energy and the emotion of the film was understood by all, regardless of language. A nice sentiment, but unfortunately, I don't think this energy translated to the screen. In the end, I think the movie felt like a series of well-done scenes, but didn't come together into a coherent whole.  \n  \n**2.5 out of 5**",

The movie is a comedy about a rock band where one of the members becomes a vampire.  \n  \nI liked some parts, and I would have been laughing out loud had I not been wearing my professional volunteer mask. There is a scene--a flashback sequence involving Malcolm McDowell's character, which incorporates footage of a young McDowell from some old movie--that was really well done. Ultimately though, the jokes were hit and miss, because it was kind of cheesy, goofy humour which doesn't always work for me. But I can see this becoming a \"cult favourite\" type of film with a good fanbase. Oh, and it's Canadian.  \n  \n**2.5 out of 5**",

And then his friend gets hurt. And then he starts killing gang members. And then the cops get involved. That's what I felt like when I was watching this movie... it was just a sequence of plot events. I never got a sense of the characters' motivations and justifications for their actions. The characters were only there to move the plot along, and I didn't care about them at all.  \n  \nFor example, there's one scene where the police detective (played by [Emily Mortimer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607865/)) suddenly goes from being confused about the situation to being _completely convinced_ that she's solved the case, all based on what I think was a very vague piece of evidence. Up to that point, she was portrayed as a fair and thoughtful detective, but then abruptly jumps to a conclusion, only because that's what was needed for the movie to set up its climax.  \n  \nOverall, it was a disappointment. That being said, there are some moments of suspense that did work well, e.g., the scene where Harry goes to buy a gun from some nasty people. And Michael Caine delivers my favourite one-liner from the festival so far. After a shootout with a bad guy, he stands victoriously over his injured opponent and says: \"You failed to maintain your weapon, son.\" Brilliant.  \n  \n**2 out of 5**",

Americans probably know the history of the event, but ignorant Canadian that I am, I was not familiar with it. So on one level, I enjoyed the movie as a history lesson. But what really drove the film for me was Ellsberg's personality. (He narrates the film and is seen throughout in the typical talking head interviews.) When he speaks, you can tell that he's absolutely committed to doing the right thing. More than that, he followed his words with actions--actions that put his own freedom at risk. I have great respect for this, and I think that he is a true hero.  \n  \nOn the negative side, I thought they overdid the portrayal of Nixon as a bad, _bad_ man. The repeated use of sound clips of Nixon saying vulgar and awful things almost came off as unintentionally funny because it was so on the nose. (E.g. someone in an interview would say something like, \"Surely, the government would not do XYZ.\" Then it would cut to a tape of Nixon saying \"By God, we better goddamn do XYZ to those sons of bitches.\") I would have preferred a little more subtlety.

([\"I had a dream that a hamburger was eating _me!_\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nDdoJX1KxM))  \n  \nThat being said, a dream I had, and the subsequent events of the next day, made me think about the nature of coincidence and superstition. The dream unfolds as follows:  \n  \nI'm at work. At some point during the work day, I get a company-wide e-mail that is, to my surprise, a notification about my own resignation. Like someone mistakenly thought that I had quit my job and was notifying everyone in the company of the sad news. Everyone starts planning a good-bye lunch and stuff, while I'm running around trying to tell them all that I hadn't really quit. Then I woke up. (I know what you're thinking. I'm perfectly happy with my job, that's not what this is about. We're not doing Freudian analysis here.)  \n  \nThe next day when I actually went to work, I tried to log in to my computer and it wouldn't accept my password. After a few attempts to make sure I didn't mistype it, I thought to myself, \"Hey, maybe they thought I quit and locked out my account.\" Turns out the network was just down briefly.  \n  \nThese events reminded me of a guest lecture that I attended in university by science writer [Simon Singh](http://www.simonsingh.net/). He told a similar story, which I paraphrase here:  \n  \n> One time I had a dream about my grandmother, who was sick at the time. I was a child in the dream and I saw my grandmother getting into a car. It was raining and dark. The car slowly drove away and I watched my grandmother turn around and wave at me through the rear window. I waved back and the car disappeared into the distance. And it felt like we were saying good-bye. That's when the phone rang and woke me up. I picked up the phone and... _(pause for dramatic effect)_... it was my boss telling me I was late for work.\n  \nEveryone in the audience had a good laugh. The point that Dr. Singh was trying to make, and that I'm trying to pass on, is that you never hear a story like that. What you do hear are stories about people who, the day after an earthquake, say that they had a dream that predicted the disaster. Or, after a car accident, they'll claim that they had a \"feeling\" before getting into the car and _knew_ that something bad was going to happen. When you really think about it though, in a city with millions of people, it's not unlikely that there is at least one person having a dream about an earthquake _every night_. And there must be someone having a bad feeling about getting into a car every minute of the day. There's nothing special about the person who happened to be right when the earthquake or car accident really does occur, other than the fact that they _just happened_ to be right.  \n  \nIf I was a superstitious person, my dream might have caused me to be a little worried that I'll get fired or something. The way to defy superstition is just to give it a moment's thought. Coincidences happen, and there's isn't always a need to search for a deeper underlying cause.",

		"content": "One of the effects of living in an apartment is that you spend a lot of time in the elevator. Of course, most of the time, you're just in there by yourself, staring at the wall. Or, if there's someone else in there with you, it's an awkward experience at best. As George Carlin put it, \"there's nothing to do in an elevator except not look at the other guy.\" But, once in a while, the elevator will be the site of a bizarre happenstance.  \n  \nThis morning, I was leaving to go to work. As I stood waiting for the elevator, I noticed that it was taking longer than usual to arrive at my floor. _Oh well_, I thought, _it's not like I'm in a hurry to get to work._  \n  \nThe elevator eventually arrived, and the door slid open. Standing in the middle of the elevator was a puppy. Just a puppy. With nobody else inside. He was a small little white dog, a terrier of some sort, and wearing a red knit sweater. Not able to help myself, I let out a high-pitched \"Awwww...\"  \n  \nWhen I stepped into the elevator, I saw that the little guy (let's call him \"Buddy,\" because what else do you call a dog you don't know?) was feeling scared, because his limbs were all shaking. I didn't know what to do, it's not really wise to try to confront a frightened animal. So I ignored him. There's nothing to do in an elevator except not look at the dog.  \n  \nPretty soon the elevator stopped at another floor. A lady came in with another dog. Apparently this woman knew Buddy, because she started to talk to him and bending down like she was going to pick him up. \"Where's your mommy? Where's your mommy?\" Buddy's nervousness increased from this woman's overexuberance, and increased further as the other dog started growling (obviously jealous of the attention that Buddy was receiving). I tried to remember whether I had ever had a rabies shot.  \n  \nFortunately, we reached the ground floor before the fur started flying. Buddy's owner (\"mommy\") was waiting. Apparently she and Buddy were about to come up the elevator when she ran into someone in the lobby and started to have a chat. Buddy had hopped into the elevator on his own before realizing that she had stayed behind. Poor Buddy. Poor, poor Buddy.",

		"content": "_N.B.: I don't normally post personal items on this blog, so this will be thinly disguised as a technology review article._  \n  \nI'm moving into my own apartment soon, and I'm pretty excited about it. In preparation, I've been shopping for some furniture, as well as thinking about how I'm going to arrange the furniture in the limited space that I have. When I was at IKEA, I saw booths set up where people were using some custom software to design their furniture layouts, and I thought it would be a good idea to try to do some \"interior design\" of my apartment using some 3D software to better visualize the space.  \n  \nI had heard good things about [Google SketchUp](http://google.com/sketchup), so I thought I would give that a shot. SketchUp is a pretty generic 3D modeling tool, but it seems like most people use it to create architectural designs. After watching some of the video tutorials on the site, and some experimentation with the interface, I was able to whip up something pretty quickly.  \n  \nVoila:\n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/1d266aab-fb6c-4699-97e0-91a71368a830)\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d70e7437-09ba-4b7f-ae89-f6381a487d8e)\n\nThis is the living room.  \n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/27710030-b632-400b-a59e-7307156ea82f)\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/cca9a991-542a-466f-b286-2bfa1c916b9d)\n\nI'm considering maybe putting another shelf next to the TV for additional storage of books, DVDs, or whatever. On the other hand, it's good to have some empty space so that it's not too cluttered. There's also a pretty large storage closet in the apartment, so anything that doesn't need to always be conveniently available, I can just put in the closet.  \n  \nHere's the bedroom.  \n\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/d2ad64eb-82ae-48c8-bb88-85d26e827c27)\n![](https://cms.alchoi.dev/assets/48cadac5-d9b0-4a66-85b8-9fb60bdebce1)\n\nThe bedroom seemed small to me when I first looked at the floorplan and at the empty apartment, but now I've seen it in 3D with the furniture models, it's not so bad.  \n  \nSo in conclusion: Google SketchUp is pretty good. Pretty, pretty good. 9/10",

		"content": "So Radiohead announced the release of a new album called \"[In Rainbows](http://www.inrainbows.com/)\", coming out October 10th. I don't think I've ever seen an album announcement so close to its release date. Usually there's months of anticipation before a release, but this time they've decided to spring this on us on short notice. Like \"Hey, new album next week!\" Apparently, they're able to do this because they're no longer signed to a record contract; this is basically an \"indie\" release.  \n  \nBecause of their newly gained indie status, the band is also doing things a little differently in terms of distributing and pricing the release. The album is coming out as an online download at first. The price: \"It's up to you.\" Kind of like selling it through an honour system. You can even download it for free, and they won't mind. (I'm going to give them a couple of bucks anyway. You know, for their trouble.) This is great and very forward-thinking of them, and gives fanboys like myself ammunition when discussing the greatness of Radiohead with fans of other, more inferior bands.  \n  \nBUT  \n  \nThey're also selling the album as a boxset to be released later this year. The boxset will have CD and vinyl versions of the album, which makes for good collector's items to be sure. But the thing that's killing me is, there's a second CD with more songs, that's _only available in the boxset_. It's like they're selling a double album where you can download the first part for free, but you have to buy the special collector's edition for the second part. And how much is the boxset? £40. Or about $80 CAD. (Or $80 USD, ha!) That's a long way from \"It's up to you.\"  \n  \nI know I'll probably buy the boxset anyways, and the fanboy in me wants to forgive them, but this is really a rip-off. It's like they're trying to trick us into thinking they're really cool by giving away the free download, just so we'll be happy to spend the money on the boxset. I only hope they'll come to their senses and make the second CD available as a standalone purchase. Otherwise, I'm boycotting Radiohead forever. Oh, who am I kidding? I love you, Thom Yorke.",

		"content": "I was reading [_The God Delusion_](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/the-god-delusion/9780618918249-item.html) by Richard Dawkins, and something occurred to me. While I worked my way through the section about the evolution vs. intelligent design debate (which any book about atheism should address), the word \"Darwinism\" kept popping up. Every time the word was used, I became more and more conscious of it; something about it bothered me.  \n  \nThe thing that struck me is this: why is Darwinism an \"-ism\"? The -ism suffix is generally used for names of religions (e.g. Judaism, Catholicism, Hinduism), or a philosophical stance (e.g. existentialism, Marxism, even atheism itself), or a political movement (e.g. feminism, abolitionism).  \n  \nDarwinism, being a scientific theory, doesn't fit into these categories. I can't think of any other scientific theories with the -ism suffix. Wouldn't it be like calling the Laws of Motion \"Newtonism\", or general relativity \"Einsteinism\", or genetics \"Watson and Crickism\"? (Or maybe \"Watsonism-and-Crickism\" to be more fair to Watson.)  \n  \nI wonder if the use of the word \"Darwinism\" weakens the evolution argument in the public eye, because it makes it sound like something less than an established theory. Maybe \"Darwinism\" has a very precise meaning that I'm unclear on, but it is commonly used when discussing evolution and natural selection. The debate between evolution and creationism (which is appropriately an -ism) is a public, cultural one; and the public, in my opinion, is not so concerned with precisely defining terms.  \n  \nA word like \"Darwinism\" lends itself to attacks of this sort: \"See? It's just some guy's opinion!\" I'd like to see the word used less, at least for the purposes of cultural debate. Charles Darwin obviously deserves a lot of credit, but in this case, a more decisive term may be more useful.",

The term \"banana\" is not as neutral as my friend makes it out to be. Personally, I don't take offense at being called a banana, but the whole concept of an Asian person acting white can be the cause of some friction. My banana status is ambiguous enough that sometimes I've been able to listen in at conversations between parents of more full-fledged bananas, and I can tell, it's really something that they have strong feelings about. They sincerely wish that their kids were \"more Chinese.\" In my own family, there's never been outright unhappiness about the issue, but I can occasionally sense an air of passive disapproval. (We don't call it \"banana\" in Cantonese, there's another term for it that I won't even attempt a translation of... it's some shit about bamboo or something.)  \n  \nAnd I can only guess what FOBs think about bananas.

		"content": "Of all the days to be travelling, and of all the airports to catch a flight connection, I had to choose January 1st, and Denver International, respectively. January 1st, when everybody is flying to get home after the holidays. Denver, where a blizzard had halted the entire city just days before. Lesson learned: never try to make a flight connection where the arrival-departure gap is only 1 hour. \n \nThe customs lineup at YYZ was one of those that wrapped around multiple times, through multiple rooms. You think the line is moving, but then you just end up standing 2 feet away from where you just were 15 minutes ago, but facing the other direction. You'd think that with such an epic queue, they'd lighten up on the customs questioning, but I got the full interrogation. \n \n\"What is your profession?\"\n\n\"What was your major?\" \n\n\"Why would a Canadian ever travel to the States for work?\" \n\n\"What school did you graduate from?\" (I was asked this twice.) \n \nBut I made it. It took only a Mild Airport Sprint to get to the flight with time to spare. The Toronto-Denver flight was only slightly late in taking off, and we landed pretty much on time. I relaxed. I even enjoyed seeing the snow, my first sight of snow this winter. The plane actually taxied on top of snow. All was well, until the following: \n \n\"Uh... this is the pilot. Unfortunately, our gate is occupied. So, unfortunately, we will have to wait until they clear us to enter the gate, unfortunately. Uh, unfortunately, I apologize for the inconvenience.\" \n \nYes, she actually used the word \"unfortunately\" four times. \n \nThere was still about a half hour before the departure time of my second leg. I talked to some of the guys seated around me. Apparently, several of us were making the same connection to San Jose. I told them, cocksure, \"Well, since there are a few of us, they'll see that this flight is late in arriving and hold it for us. We should be okay.\" Sure enough, the plane started moving again. We had been assigned to another gate. Fortunately. \n \n\"This is the pilot. Our gate is open, but we need to wait for the marshal to guide us in.\" The marshal? How about the sheriff, or the deputy? Do we have to wait for them to show up too? \n \nThirty minutes passed before we finally pulled in. I've never heard so many buckles being disengaged prior to \"the captain has determined it safe to leave your seats, and has turned off the seat belt sign\". Now it was time for a Fierce Airport Sprint. One of my temporary airplane friends and I arrived at the departure gate, but it was too late. We would have to stay the night in Denver. \n \nLet's look at the bright side, shall we? I got a free hotel stay. I got nine dollars for dinner. I got four dollars for breakfast. More accurately, since this is a business trip, I earned my company a free hotel stay and thirteen dollars of food vouchers. Most importantly, when I arrived at my final destination in the afternoon the next day, it was too late to go to work, but not so late that I had to go right to bed. So I went and saw _Apocalypto_.

These are moments in a story where the characters seem to be in a hopeless situation, but then something completely unexpected or unrealistic comes along to bail them out of it. This kind of plot device is okay if used in moderation, but it happens way too many times in _Da Vinci Code_. To wit: \n \n(Spoilers ahead... although the spoilers basically amount to: they don't die.) \n \n* Robert and Sophie are trapped in an armoured truck. A villain is pointing a gun at them. Instead of just shooting them, the villain decides to close the door of the truck, right onto a bullet shell casing that Robert had just happened to kick into the doorway. The door bounces back and the villain comically bangs his head on it. Yes, yes, I know in the book some explanation is given as to why he pushed the shell casing into the doorway... but really, I'm not going to go and read it again. \n   \n* Robert and Sophie are standing in some church. A villain is pointing a gun at them. Suddenly, a dove flies by and distracts the villain, who then proceeds to forget how to shoot a gun. He fires and misses. A dove flies by! What is this, a John Woo movie? \n   \n* Ian McKellan is sitting in his house. A villain (Silas the crazy monk) is pointing a gun at him. He grabs his crutches and swings. Incredibly, Silas, who we have just seen killing a nun with a single, well-timed and ruthless strike, fails to react fast enough to shoot Ian McKellan at point blank range. I would expect Jackie Chan to be able to pull a move like that off, but Ian McKellan? And this isn't Gandalf Ian McKellan. Or Magneto Ian McKellan. It's crippled scholar Ian McKellan!\n\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.",

		"description": "Dragon in the garage",
		"content": "I've been reading a pretty interesting book called _The Demon-Haunted World_ by Carl Sagan (author of [Contact](http://thegooseunderstands.blogspot.com/2006/01/contact.html)). The book is basically an extended diatribe against pseudoscience or \"junk science.\" Sagan addresses such issues as alien abduction, UFOs, psychic healers, psychic mediums, etc. He believes that the general public is antipathetic towards true science, and instead embraces superstition and the supernatural as legitimate forms of scientific knowledge. Here's an excerpt, which is also printed on the back cover:  \n\n> I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity, during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when fanaticism is bubbling up around us--then, habits of thought familiar from ages past reach for the controls.\n\nI found his examination of the alien abduction \"phenomenon\" especially interesting. Throughout history, people have been seeing things. In the Middle Ages, it was demons (that's where the title of the book comes from). Hallucinations continued through time, going from demons to saints to witches, and now aliens. Sagan's view is that whatever fears are in the minds of the public at a certain time in history, that's what people will see, or claim to see. Makes a lot of sense to me... We look back at these stories of witch hunts and exorcisms and such things with the sense that we're progressed above that, so how can alien abduction be taken so seriously by so many? Sagan is actually an enthusiast when it comes to extraterrestrial life. He was involved in SETI and other scientific methods to find alien intelligence. This makes his arguments all the more powerful. I have great respect for the fact that despite his personal goals and his desire to believe in alien life, Sagan was able to produce such a comprehensive work of skepticism.  \n  \nI wonder what Carl Sagan would have thought about the whole ~~Intelligent Design~~ intelligent design concept. (I refuse to capitalize it.) One of the main themes of _The Demon-Haunted World_ is the willingness of individuals to ignore science, and the scientific method in particular, because of its difficulty. Mainstream society even subtly encourages ignorance, because wild pseudoscientific theories are just more entertaining. It's somewhat more disturbing in the case of intelligent design, because it goes beyond mainstream media and entertainment. Intelligent design backers are actually trying to turn a religious belief into a science, and teach it as a science. I have nothing against anybody's religious beliefs, it's the attempt to institutionalize them that I find appalling. One part of the book in particular made me think of the intelligent design controversy. Sagan describes a hypothetical dragon living in his garage to make the point that if there's no way to disprove an assertion, then there's no scientific meaning to that assertion. (E.g. you can't test that the dragon is there by seeing it because it's invisible, you can't test by looking for footprints because it's flying, etc... You can counter any way of experimentally testing the existence of the dragon by giving the dragon some arbitrary property.) Sagan's dragon, in a way, is a precursor to the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_spaghetti_monster) (albeit not as funny).  \n  \nMy only complaint/concern about this book is that it's preaching to the converted. I can't imagine someone who's not already interested in science reading it. I enjoyed reading it, but it didn't really change how I think about the world, as I pretty much agreed with all of what he was saying. Even if a \"non-scientific\" person reads the book, he/she might be put off by Sagan's harsh tone, condemning mainstream society for its gullibility. He/she might actually be insulted and turn away from science even more. (\"These scientists think they're so smart and that they're better than us.\") I'm guessing that this is the fate that was eventually suffered by the book. It was written in 1996 and I don't think it's been particularly successful. Nevertheless, it was thought-provoking and worth a read.",

The real big announcement was the [Google Video Store](http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/video_marketplace.html), but that's not out yet... and besides, I don't have anything to complain about with that.)  \n  \nThat said, the [Google Pack](http://pack.google.com/) is the first time I've been disappointed with something Google has done. First of all, it's not a product at all... it's just an installer. There's nothing here that I can't download and install myself (e.g. Firefox, Acrobat Reader), but they're [hyping](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/make-your-computer-just-work.html) it like it's revolutionizing the desktop experience.  \n  \nWhat I disliked about the Pack is that it gives you no control over what you're installing. You download the executable, run it, and the next thing you know, the thing is downloading 50+ Megs of software and installing it. There is apparently a way to configure what gets installed, as explained on the [About page](http://pack.google.com/about.html):  \n  \n\n> **Do I have to install all the software in the Google Pack?**  \n> While we believe you'll find all of the software in the Google Pack useful, you're welcome to install as much or as little as you'd like. To customize your installation package, please click the \"Add or remove software\" link under the download button on the Google Pack homepage. On the Customize page, simply uncheck the box next to any program you'd prefer not to install and click the \"Continue\" button to complete the installation process.  \n\nI honestly didn't see the link under the download button when I downloaded it, and there's no excuse for not reading carefully before downloading, but this is the kind of thing that you would expect from the RealPlayer installer (a checkbox saying \"Do you not want to not install the RealPlayer Message Centre?\"). Configuring an installation before you download it is completely counterintuitive to what we expect from every other application out there.  \n  \nI'm willing to give Google the benefit of the doubt on this one--maybe they felt that the average user would prefer to have a one-click installation--but if I see this kind of trickery from them again... I'll... uh... start using MSN Search!",

		"description": "Anyone can edit",
		"content": "There's been some controversy over [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/) lately, and it takes the form of a lawsuit against the online encyclopedia. Someone has started a website at [WikipediaClassAction.org]() (_update 2021/12/30: this link has been disabled because it now leads to an adult site_), which plans to file a lawsuit against Wikipedia, on the basis that there is harmful and inaccurate information in some Wikipedia articles.  \n  \nWikipedia is well known for being an open encyclopedia, i.e. anyone can edit the articles. The idea is that for any given topic, someone in the world has the knowledge to be able to write about it. If this person posts some erroneous information (either intentionally or not), then someone else in the world will have the knowledge to correct it. In my experience, this model works, and Wikipedia has become one of my favourite sources of information. If something in an article seems controversial or somehow \"not right\" to me, a quick look at the discussion page for the article will show that the community is aware of the potential issues and is working to amend the entry.  \n  \nThere is no doubt that Wikipedia will never be 100% accurate at all times. The fact that it's a collaborative effort necessarily implies that any information posted can evolve. Also, differences between one author's perspective of a certain topic and another's are bound to arise. The point is that it's open for everyone to discuss and decide on an article's final content cooperatively. I believe that when it comes to information, a large open community has more to offer than a single \"authoritative\" source, even if it means the occasional error or bug.  \n  \nThis lawsuit was sparked in part by an incident involving the biographical entry of [John Seigenthaler Sr.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seigenthaler_Sr.) Someone posted false information (apparently as a joke) implying that Seigenthaler had been involved in JFK's assassination. The lawsuit claims that because of Wikipedia's open nature, such misinformation is more likely to be spread. The ironic part of it is, as soon as the story came out, it was loudly discussed, and much attention was brought to that particular article. It has since been fixed, and in fact, there is now [another article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Seigenthaler_Sr._Wikipedia_biography_controversy) explaining the whole situation. Doesn't this show the openness of the system actually serves to increase its accuracy? People will make false statements, through all kinds of media, whether they are open to the public or not. What's worse, a self-correcting system such as Wikipedia, where information becomes fact only when agreed upon by everyone? Or supposedly authorative sources (e.g. the [news media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensationalism)) which routinely present opinions as fact?  \n  \nI fear that this lawsuit might actually have some success. They'll never be able to shut down Wikipedia (at least, I certainly hope not), but they might succeed in forcing them to do something stupid like dropping the \"pedia\" from the name, just because it's \"misleading.\" No matter what happens, I'll continue to use and support the Wikipedia project.",

		"description": "Pandora",
		"content": "Let me explain. There’s this online music player called [Pandora](http://pandora.com/), which is supposed to “read your mind” and play music that you would like. You start off by giving it the name of an artist or song that you like, and it will play things that it deems “similar.” The people behind Pandora analyzed a whole bunch of songs and assigned traits to them using a lot of pretentious musical terms, like “subtle syncopation” and “minor key harmonic tonalities”. (They call this the “Music Genome Project.”) The player uses these traits and builds a playlist of other songs or artists that share the same properties.\n\nI’m sure that the system works well, but for some reason, I just don’t like most of the stuff it plays. I give it some of my favourites like Radiohead and Björk, and it just starts playing absolute crap. The common traits are definitely there, but I end up not really enjoying the playlist it generates.\n\nIt could be that I’m just picky, but I think the whole concept is fundamentally flawed. It’s very difficult to quantify the elements that make you like or dislike music. For example, you might like a particular song for its repetitive beat, but another song with a repetitive beat might drive you nuts. Pandora is a noble effort, and I’m sure many people will like it, but unfortunately it just doesn’t work for me.",

He began his justification of his recommendation thusly (I’m paraphrasing here):\n\n“Jessica Alba is a pretty girl. She’s pretty in this movie. So that’s a thumbs up.”\n\nCan’t argue with that, Roger Ebert. Of course, he tried to give other reasons for liking the movie, but it was altogether unconvincing. I propose that Ebert & Roeper introduce a “thumb down, penis up” rating for just this purpose.",

At least with a Windows PC, you can open the thing up and add and remove parts yourself.\n  \nJust look at the iPod, for example. The fact that it uses a non-standard connector to interface with the PC means that there are a whole bunch of products (e.g. USB cables) that you can't use with the iPod, and also that there are a whole bunch of iPod-specific products that don't work with anything else.  \n  \nYeah, but that means the good Apple engineers can optimize for the hardware and make it work really fast...  \n  \nUh... but it's harmful to consumers when these incompatibilities arise... it takes away their choices...  \n  \nThat's okay, if everybody uses an iPod, then there won't be any incompatibilities... and it'll be really easy to find iPod-compatible products because all the manufacturers will be on the iPod bandwagon...  \n  \nBut... but...

		"content": "As [promised](/blog/2005/03/battle-of-the-audio-players), I did a bit of research to find out what it would take to get LongPlayer to work together with amaroK. It turns out that amaroK supports a DCOP interface. DCOP is a protocol shared by KDE applications that allows you to control them via the command line. For example, you can add songs to the amaroK playlist by executing the following shell command:  \n  \n```\ndcop amarok playlist addMedia  \n```\n  \nIt's definitely possible to modify LongPlayer to use these DCOP commands to control amaroK, instead of performing the equivalent operations with XMMS. And it's probably not even difficult.  \n  \nUnfortunately (or fortunately), while I was looking into this, I realized that everything I liked about amaroK were just gimmicks (e.g. lyrics lookup, album cover images). After initially being impressed with all these bells and whistles, I came to see that there's ultimately no real usefulness to any of it. On the other hand, LongPlayer really does perform a useful function, and changes the user's experience.  \n  \nTherefore, I declare the LongPlayer/XMMS combination to be the winner of this little competition. Somewhat anti-climactic, but I'm glad it turned out this way... saves me the trouble of actually going through with modifying LongPlayer code.  \n  \n(Aside: I think I learned a bit about myself through this little \"ordeal.\" I may at first be impressed by superficial things, but I eventually tend to gravitate towards a more practical ideal. In general, this probably does describe my general outlook on things. So, there you go: self-discovery through software.)",

		"description": "No probability theory",
		"content": "I've arrived at a bit of a crossroads concerning audio player software, and which one to use. I have a moderately large collection of music on my computer, and dumping everything onto a playlist and shuffling isn't quite good enough for me.  \n  \nI've narrowed it down to two candidates:  \n  \n## XMMS + LongPlayer  \n  \n[XMMS](http://xmms.org/) is pretty much the standard audio player on Linux (it's basically a clone of Winamp). However, its shuffle functionality (as with most audio players) is pretty rudimentary. In particular, it is susceptible to the so-called [birthday paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox). I have no desire to start explaining probability theory here, but essentially, this means that it does not take long for the same song to be played twice, which quickly becomes annoying.  \n  \n[LongPlayer](http://lplayer.sourceforge.net/) is a program that runs alongside XMMS (it also works with Winamp on Windows, and iTunes on MacOS), which basically continually populates your playlist queue with \"random\" songs. It is not completely random, because that would lead to the birthday paradox; instead, it tries to play the songs in such a way as to maximize the average time between playing the same song twice. Also, it supports a rating system which causes the higher-rated songs to be played more often.  \n  \nThe combination of XMMS and LongPlayer does a very good job of randomizing my playlist. On average, it takes about 4 weeks for a song to be played again (according to LongPlayer's statistics).  \n  \n## amaroK  \n  \n[amaroK](http://amarok.kde.org/) takes a completely different approach. This is the most full-featured music player I've seen. It places a strong emphasis on organizing a collection of music, and can group your tracks based on genre, artist, year, etc. It also uses this information to make suggestions as you're playing something; for example, it gives you a list of albums by the same artist, and other artists of a similar genre.  \n  \nI also like the fact that amaroK downloads album covers from Amazon.com and displays them as you're playing tracks. It even displays lyrics for the currently playing song. (How this works, I don't know--I should take a look at the source code.) Yes, I know that these are kind of frivolous features, but it gives the app a professional, polished feel.  \n  \nSo, here's the dilemma. I really like the full-featuredness of amaroK, but its shuffling mechanism is pretty basic. There is a rating mechanism, but it doesn't seem to obviously affect the selection of tracks. Now, amaroK is a larger project than LongPlayer, so it is likely that future updates will have an improved shuffling function. In fact, many people have requested a smarter shuffle on the amaroK forums.  \n  \nThe \"best-of-both-worlds\" solution would be if LongPlayer could interface with amaroK and feed songs into the amaroK playlist. I believe that this should be possible, because both apps are open-source. If I have time, I'll try to find out more about this... (to be continued...)",
